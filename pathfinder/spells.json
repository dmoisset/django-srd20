The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level.</p><p>You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts <i><a href=\"suggestion.html#_suggestion\">suggestion</a></i>, your caster level for this casting of <i>binding </i>increases by 1. For each assistant who casts <i><a href=\"dominateAnimal.html#_dominate-animal\">dominate animal</a>, <a href=\"dominatePerson.html#_dominate-person\">dominate person</a>, </i>or <i><a href=\"dominateMonster.html#_dominate-monster\">dominate monster</a>, </i>your caster level for this casting of <i>binding </i>increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a <i>binding </i>spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding </i>spell, saving throws and <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">spell resistance</a> against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial <a href=\"../combat.html#_will\">Will</a> saving throw and how long the <i>binding </i>lasts. All <i>binding </i>spells are dismissible.</p><p>Regardless of the version of <i>binding </i>you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.</p><p>If you cast any of the first three versions of <i>binding </i>(those with limited durations), you may cast additional <i>binding </i>spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature's save succeeds, all <i>binding </i>spells it has received are broken.</p><p>The <i>binding </i>spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.</p><p><i>Chaining</i>: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <i><a href=\"antipathy.html#_antipathy\">antipathy</a> </i>spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding </i>is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.</p><p><i>Slumber</i>: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding </i>is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a <a href=\"sleep.html#_sleep\">sleep</a> effect.</p><p><i>Bound Slumber</i>: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a <a href=\"sleep.html#_sleep\">sleep</a> effect.</p><p><i>Hedged Prison</i>: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.</p><p><i>Metamorphosis</i>: The subject assumes <a href=\"gaseousForm.html#_gaseous-form\">gaseous form</a>, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding </i>is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p><p><i>Minimus Containment</i>: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The <i>binding </i>is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age.

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i>Dispel magic </i>can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic </i>can take effect. </p><p>You choose to use <i>dispel magic </i>in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.</p><p><i>Targeted Dispel</i>: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic </i>spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.</p><p> For example, a 7th-level caster casts <i>dispel magic</i>, targeting a creature affected by <i><a href=\"stoneskin.html#_stoneskin\">stoneskin</a> </i>(caster level 12th) and <i>fly</i> (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the <i><a href=\"stoneskin.html#_stoneskin\">stoneskin</a></i> (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the <i>fly</i> (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the <i><a href=\"stoneskin.html#_stoneskin\">stoneskin</a></i> would have been dispelled, leaving the <i>fly </i>intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a <i><a href=\"wallOfFire.html#_wall-of-fire\">wall of fire</a></i>). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>summon monster</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p><p><i>Counterspell</i>: When <i>dispel magic </i>is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic </i>may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p>",

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.</p><p>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <i>gate.</i></p><p>The <i>gate </i>itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.</p><p>A <i>gate </i>has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <i>gate </i>from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.</p><p><i>Planar Travel</i>: As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate </i>spell functions much like a <i><a href=\"planeShift.html#_plane-shift\">plane shift</a> </i>spell, except that the <i>gate </i>opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a <i>gate </i>from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A <i>gate </i>cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.</p><p>You may hold the <i>gate </i>open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.</p><p><i>Calling Creatures</i>: The second effect of the <i>gate </i>spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate </i>to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate, </i>although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate </i>that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.</p><p>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.</p><p>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <i><a href=\"planarAlly.html#_planar-ally-lesser\">lesser planar ally</a> </i>spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.</p><p>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.</p><p><i>Note</i>: When you use a calling spell such as <i>gate </i>to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.</p>",

Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whomever or whatever is near them.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Caster Level</th><th>Centipedes</th><th>Scorpions</th><th>Spiders</th></tr></thead><tr class=\"odd\"><td>9th or lower</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>10th–13th</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>14th–17th</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>18th–19th</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>20th or higher</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr></table>",

The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.</p><p><i>Fog</i>: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including <a href=\"../glossary.html#_darkvision\">darkvision</a>, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: none. <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">Spell Resistance</a>: no.</p><p><i>Arcane Locks</i>: All doors in the warded area are <i><a href=\"arcaneLock.html#_arcane-lock\">arcane lock</a>ed. </i>Saving Throw: none. <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">Spell Resistance</a>: no.</p><p><i>Webs</i>: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom.

This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: none. <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">Spell Resistance</a>: yes.</p><p><i>Lost Doors</i>: One door per caster level is covered by a <i><a href=\"silentImage.html#_silent-image\">silent image</a> </i>to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: <a href=\"../combat.html#_will\">Will</a> disbelief (if interacted with). <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">Spell Resistance</a>: no.</p><p>In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.</p><p>1. <i><a href=\"dancingLights.html#_dancing-lights\">Dancing lights</a> </i>in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the <i>guards and wards </i>spell lasts. Saving Throw: none. <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">Spell Resistance</a>: no.</p><p>2. A <i><a href=\"magicMouth.html#_magic-mouth\">magic mouth</a> </i>in two places. Saving Throw: none. <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">Spell Resistance</a>: no.</p><p>3. A <i><a href=\"stinkingCloud.html#_stinking-cloud\">stinking cloud</a> </i>in two places.

Saving Throw: <a href=\"../combat.html#_fortitude\">Fortitude</a> negates. <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">Spell Resistance</a>: yes.</p><p>5.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">spell resistance</a> in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i><a href=\"protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil\">protection from evil</a></i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">spell resistance</a>.</p><p>This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against evil </i>can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i><a href=\"planarBinding.html#_planar-binding-lesser\">lesser planar binding</a>, <a href=\"planarBinding.html#_planar-binding\">planar binding</a>, </i>and <i><a href=\"planarBinding.html#_planar-binding-greater\">greater planar binding</a> </i>spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i><a href=\"protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil\">protection from evil</a> </i>spell for that creature only.</p><p>A <i>magic circle </i>leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">spell resistance</a>, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">spell resistance</a>, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i><a href=\"astralProjection.html#_astral-projection\">astral projection</a>, blink, <a href=\"dimensionDoor.html#_dimension-door\">dimension door</a>, <a href=\"etherealness.html#_etherealness\">etherealness</a>, <a href=\"gate.html#_gate\">gate</a>, <a href=\"planeShift.html#_plane-shift\">plane shift</a>, <a href=\"shadowWalk.html#_shadow-walk\">shadow walk</a>, <a href=\"teleport.html#_teleport\">teleport</a>, </i>and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i><a href=\"dimensionalAnchor.html#_dimensional-anchor\">dimensional anchor</a> </i>spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor </i>effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle </i>does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle, </i>but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle </i>more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i><a href=\"dimensionalAnchor.html#_dimensional-anchor\">dimensional anchor</a> </i>spell on the <i>magic circle </i>during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor </i>holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle </i>for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">spell resistance</a> against a <i>magic circle </i>prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a <a href=\"../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new\">Charisma</a> check to break free of the trap (see the <i><a href=\"planarBinding.html#_planar-binding-lesser\">lesser planar binding</a> </i>spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.</p><p>This spell is not cumulative with <i><a href=\"protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil\">protection from evil</a> </i>and vice versa.</p>",

To cast the spell, the <i>magic jar </i>must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. </p><p>While in the <i>magic jar, </i>you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)</p><p>You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.</p><p>Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <i><a href=\"protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil\">protection from evil</a> </i>or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the <i>magic jar </i>unless the subject succeeds on a <a href=\"../combat.html#_will\">Will</a> save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i>magic jar, </i>and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.</p><p>If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the <i>magic jar. </i>You keep your <a href=\"../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence\">Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom\">Wisdom</a>, <a href=\"../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new\">Charisma</a>, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities.

A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.</p><p>As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar </i>if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.</p><p>If the host body is slain, you return to the <i>magic jar, </i>if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.</p><p>If the spell ends while you are in the <i>magic jar, </i>you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar </i>returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the <i>magic jar </i>or the host's location.</p>",

The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.</p><p>To create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle </i>spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.</p><p>The target creature is allowed a <a href=\"../combat.html#_will\">Will</a> saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (<a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">spell resistance</a> does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">spell resistance</a> against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful <a href=\"../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new\">Charisma</a> check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your <a href=\"../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new\">Charisma</a> modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i><a href=\"dimensionalAnchor.html#_dimensional-anchor\">dimensional anchor</a> </i>cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i><a href=\"magicCircleAgainstEvil.html#_magic-circle-against-evil\">magic circle against evil</a></i>) to make the trap more secure.</p><p>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a <a href=\"../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new\">Charisma</a> check opposed by the creature's <a href=\"../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new\">Charisma</a> check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the <a href=\"../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new\">Charisma</a> check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you.</p><p>Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.</p><p>When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. </p>",

A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.</p><p>It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class.

If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.</p><p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target.

It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10–1. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.</p><p>A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as <i><a href=\"wish.html#_wish\">wish</a></i>).</p><p>When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10–1 marked with an “*” are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an “*” always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment.</p>",

subtype, or a giant). The summoned ally appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions as you command.</p><p>A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells that have expensive material components (such as <i><a href=\"wish.html#_wish\">wish</a></i>).</p><p>The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10–2. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.</p><p>When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. All creatures summoned with this spell without alignment subtypes have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment. </p>",

            "description": "<p>This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a <i>symbol of death </i>kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death </i>affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol </i>becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death </i>is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol </i>only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol </i>is still active, it must save again.</p><p>Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death </i>is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death </i>must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death </i>ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death </i>works normally.</p><p>As a default, a <i>symbol of death </i>is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</p><p>In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death </i>to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a <i>symbol of death </i>offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered <i>symbol of death</i> remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death </i>is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death </i>cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</p><p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of death </i>can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify. </p><p>When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect<i>. </i>Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p><p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death, </i>but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death </i>cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.</p><p><i><a href=\"readMagic.html#_read-magic\">Read magic</a> </i>allows you to identify a <i>symbol </i>with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the <i>symbol's </i>spell level). Of course, if the <i>symbol </i>is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.</p><p>A <i>symbol of death </i>can be removed by a successful <i><a href=\"dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic\">dispel magic</a> </i>targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase </i>spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death. </i>Destruction of the surface where a <i>symbol of death </i>is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol </i>but also triggers it.</p><p><i>Symbol of death </i>can be made permanent with a <i><a href=\"permanency.html#_permanency\">permanency</a> </i>spell. A permanent <i>symbol of death </i>that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.</p><p><i>Note</i>: Magic traps such as <i>symbol of death </i>are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a <i>symbol of death </i>and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for <i>symbol of death</i>.</p>",

            "description": "<p>This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">spell resistance</a> applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and <a href=\"../glossary.html#_spell-resistance\">spell resistance</a>.</p><p>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p><p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.</p><p><i>Familiarity</i>: “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as <i><a href=\"scrying.html#_scrying\">scrying</a></i>. </p><p>“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.</p><p><i>On Target</i>: You appear where you want to be.</p><p><i>Off Target</i>: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.</p><p><i>Similar Area</i>: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.</p><p><i>Mishap</i>: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Familiarity</th><th>On Target</th><th>Off Target</th><th>Similar Area</th><th>Mishap</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Very familiar</td><td>01–97</td><td>98–99</td><td>100</td><td>—</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Studied carefully</td><td>01–94</td><td>95–97</td><td>98–99</td><td>100</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>Seen casually</td><td>01–88</td><td>89–94</td><td>95–98</td><td>99–100</td></tr><tr class=\"even\"><td>Viewed once</td><td>01–76</td><td>77–88</td><td>89–96</td><td>97–100</td></tr><tr class=\"odd\"><td>False destination</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>81–92</td><td>93–100</td></tr></tbody></table>",

This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave. </p><p>When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell). The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM's discretion.</p><p>The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave's crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that. The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city). </p><p>You can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate. </p>",
