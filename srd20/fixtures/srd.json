Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding</i> spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the <i>binding</i> lasts. All <i>binding</i> spells are dismissible.</p>\r\n      <p>Regardless of the version of <i>binding</i> you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.</p>\r\n      <p>If you are casting any of the first three versions of <i>binding</i> (those with limited durations), you may cast additional <i>binding</i> spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the <i>binding</i> spells it has received are broken.</p>\r\n      <p>The <i>binding</i> spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Chaining:</i> The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <i>Antipathy</i> spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding</i> is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Slumber:</i> This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while <i>slumbering</i>, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding</i> is more difficult to cast than <i>chaining</i>, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Bound Slumber:</i> This combination of <i>chaining</i> and <i>slumber</i> lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Hedged Prison:</i> The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Metamorphosis:</i> The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <i>metamorphosed</i>, nor does it age.

The swarm goes where the character goes at his or her speed, even if the character takes to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the <i>crown of vermin</i> bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or the character forces the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for 1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who fall prey to the <i>crown of vermin</i>. The vermin have damage reduction 1/epic, so the vermin's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If there aren't enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell's effect, the creature with the fewest hit points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit points, and so on.

Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and move the vermin in any fashion he or she desires within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a move-equivalent action. The vermin cannot be wrested from the character's control through any means. The vermin make all saving throws to avoid damaging effects using the character's base saving throw bonuses. They gain the character's spell resistance, if any, and they get saving throws against spells that would otherwise automatically slay vermin.

      "description": "\n      <p>You can use <i>dispel magic</i> to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i>dispel magic</i> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.</p>\n      <p><i>Note:</i> The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic</i> can take effect.</p>\n      <p>You choose to use <i>dispel magic</i> in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:</p>\n      <p><i>Targeted Dispel:</i> One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.</p>\n      <p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p>\n      <p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p>\n      <p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p>\n      <p><i>Area Dispel:</i> When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.</p>\n      <p>For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the <i>dispel magic</i> spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.</p>\n      <p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.</p>\n      <p>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.</p>\n      <p>For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p>\n      <p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.</p>\n      <p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.</p>\n      <p><i>Counterspell:</i> When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

The specific effect of an <i>earthquake</i> spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.</p>\n      <p><i>Cave</i>,  <i>Cavern</i>,  <i>or Tunnel:</i> The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An <i>earthquake</i> cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.</p>\n      <p><i>Cliffs: Earthquake</i> causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p>\n      <p><i>Open Ground:</i> Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.</p>\n      <p><i>Structure:</i> Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p>\n      <p><i>River</i>,  <i>Lake</i>,  <i>or Marsh:</i> Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p>\n      <p><i>Pinned beneath Rubble:</i> Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

For each additional negative level the character bestow upon him or her self at the time of casting, the eidolon has one additional character level. No matter how many negative levels the character bestows on him or her self, the eidolon can never have more character levels than the character has (taking the negative levels into account).

The eidolon is considered fresh and rested when created. It may cast any spell the character has access to, including an epic spell. Use the eidolon's Spellcraft modifier as the basis for the number of epic spells it can cast in a day, and its effective character level as a basis for its skills, feats, and other abilities. The eidolon is effectively lower level than the character and probably can't cast all the spells he or she knows. A powerful enough eidolon might conceivably cast the <i>eidolon</i> spell itself. The eidolon appears in whatever mundane clothing the character desires when initially conjured, but it has no other possessions. It shares part of the character's soul, so it is the character for all intents and purposes. The character and his or her <i>eidolon</i> communicate with each other normally. Usually, the eidolon does not begrudge its brief existence, because it is still part of the character. If the eidolon is killed prior to the expiration of the spell's duration, the character immediately regains the lost levels.

      "description": "\n      <p>Casting a <i>gate</i> spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.</p>\n      <p>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <i>gate</i>.</p>\n      <p>The <i>gate</i> itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.</p>\n      <p>A <i>gate</i> has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <i>gate</i> from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.</p>\n      <p><i>Planar Travel:</i> As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate</i> spell functions much like a <i>plane shift</i> spell, except that the <i>gate</i> opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a <i>gate</i> from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you-anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A <i>gate</i> cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.</p>\n      <p>You may hold the <i>gate</i> open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.</p>\n      <p><i>Calling Creatures:</i> The second effect of the <i>gate</i> spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate</i> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate</i>,  although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate</i> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).</p>\n      <p>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.</p>\n      <p>A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.</p>\n      <p>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <i>lesser planar ally</i> spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in 'livestock' rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.</p>\n      <p>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.</p>\n      <p><i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell such as <i>gate</i> to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

The spellcaster determines factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This spell cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). The spellcaster must add these things in some other fashion if he or she desires. Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, the spellcaster can continue to cast this spell to enlarge the demiplane, adding another 180 feet of radius to the demiplane each time.</p>\n    ",

The hand then beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow.</p>\n      <p>When the spell is cast, the hand appears in front of you. You then specify a person (or any creature) by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the description is complete, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away she is.</p>\n      <table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td><b>Distance</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Time to Locate</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>100 ft. or less<br/></td>\n<td>1 round<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>1,000 ft.<br/></td>\n<td>1 minute<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>1 mile<br/></td>\n<td>10 minutes<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>2 miles<br/></td>\n<td>1 hour<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>3 miles<br/></td>\n<td>2 hours<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>4 miles<br/></td>\n<td>3 hours<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>5 miles<br/></td>\n<td>4 hours<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table>\n      <p>Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it.

If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on her own devices to locate you.</p>\n      <p>If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.</p>\n      <p>If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.</p>\n      <p>The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you.

A <i>magic circle against evil</i> can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding</i>,  <i>planar binding</i>,  and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from evil</i> spell for that creature only.</p>\n      <p>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection</i>,  <i>blink</i>,  <i>dimension door</i>,  <i>etherealness</i>,  <i>gate</i>,  <i>plane shift</i>,  <i>shadow walk</i>,  <i>teleport</i>,  and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle</i>,  but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.</p>\n      <p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.</p>\n      <p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i> prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.</p>\n      <p>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body.

You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy.

It is blocked by <i>protection from evil</i> or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the <i>magic jar</i> unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i>magic jar</i>,  and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.</p>\n      <p>If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the <i>magic jar</i>. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities.

This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.</p>\n      <p>A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.</p>\n      <p>A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.</p>\n      <p>At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).</p>\n      <p><i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.</p>\n      <p>To create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle</i> spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.</p>\n      <p>The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i>magic circle against evil</i>) to make the trap more secure.</p>\n      <p>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.</p>\n      <p>Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free.

If the <i>protection from evil</i> effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.</p>\n      <p>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.</p>\n      <p>Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete.  When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.</p>\n      <p>A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can't be reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.</p>\n      <p>It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.</p>\n      <p>For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.</p>\n      <p>A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell.

The caster can cast the energy forth as a bolt, imbue an object with the energy, or create a freestanding manifestation of the energy. If the spell developed using the <i>energy</i> seed releases a bolt, that bolt instantaneously deals 10d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type, and all in the bolt's area must make a Reflex save for half damage. For each additional 1d6 points of damage dealt, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The bolt begins at the caster's fingertips. To imbue another creature with the ability to use an energy bolt as a spell-like ability at its option or when a particular condition is met, increase the Spellcraft DC by +25. The caster can also cause a creature or object to emanate the specific energy type out to a radius of 10 feet for 20 hours. The emanated energy deals 2d6 points of energy damage per round against unprotected creatures (the target creature is susceptible if not separately warded or otherwise resistant to the energy). For each additional 1d6 points of damage emanated, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The caster may also create a wall, half-circle, circle, dome, or sphere of the desired energy that emanates the energy for up to 20 hours. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of energy, dealing 2d4 points of energy damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of energy damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and in each round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6+20 points of energy damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. For each additional 1d4 points of damage, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.</p>\n      <p>The caster can also use the <i>energy</i> seed to create a spell that carefully releases and balances the emanation of cold, electricity, and fire, creating specific weather effects for a period of 20 hours. Using the <i>energy</i> seed this way has a base Spellcraft DC of 25. The area extends to a two-mile-radius centered on the caster. Once the spell is cast, the weather takes 10 minutes to manifest. Ordinarily, a caster can't directly target a creature or object, though indirect effects are possible. This seed can create cold snaps, heat waves, thunderstorms, fogs, blizzards-even a tornado that moves randomly in the affected area. Creating targeted damaging effects requires an additional use of the <i>energy</i> seed.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

The caster is free to act for 5 rounds of apparent time. Fire, cold, poison gas, and similar effects can still harm the caster. While the caster is in the fast time stream, other creatures are invulnerable to his or her attacks and spells; however, the caster can create spell effects and leave them to take effect when he or she reenters normal time. Because of the branching nature of time, epic spells used to transport a subject into a faster time stream cannot be made permanent, nor can the duration of 5 rounds be extended. More simply, the seed can <i>haste</i> or <i>slow</i> a subject for 20 rounds by transporting it to the appropriate time stream. This decreases the Spellcraft DC by -4.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

Alternatively, the caster can ward just the target and not create the radius effect. For each additional level of spells to be excluded, increase the Spellcraft DC by +20 (but see below).

This includes spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from magic items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the ward. The caster can leave and return to the protected area without penalty (unless the spell specifically targets a creature and does not provide a radius effect). The ward could be brought down by a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell. Epic spells using the <i>Dispel</i> seed may bring down a ward if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.</p>\n      <p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon</i> is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.</p>\n      <p>A <i>spiritual weapon</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>spiritual weapon</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).</p>\n      <p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>\n      <p>The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon</i> of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows.</p>\n      <div topic='Chaos: Battleaxe' level='8'><p><i>Chaos:</i> Battleaxe</p>\n</div>\n      <div topic='Evil: Light Flail' level='8'><p><i>Evil:</i> Light flail</p>\n</div>\n      <div topic='Good: Warhammer' level='8'><p><i>Good:</i> Warhammer</p><p><i>Law:</i> Longsword,</p><p/>\n</div>\n    ",

      "description": "\n      <p>This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a <i>symbol of death</i> slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death</i> affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol</i> becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death</i> is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol</i> only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol</i> is still active, it must save again.</p>\n      <p>Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death</i> is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death</i> must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death</i> ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death</i> works normally.</p>\n      <p>As a default, a <i>symbol of death</i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</p>\n      <p>In this case, 'reading' the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death</i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a <i>symbol of death</i> offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death</i> is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</p>\n      <p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of death</i> can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.</p>\n      <p>When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p>\n      <p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death</i>,  but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.</p>\n      <p><i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol of death</i> with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the <i>symbol of death</i> is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.</p>\n      <p>A <i>symbol of death</i> can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death</i>. Destruction of the surface where a <i>symbol of death</i> is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol</i> but also triggers it.</p>\n      <p><i>symbol of death</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>symbol of death</i> that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.</p>\n      <p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>symbol of death</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a <i>symbol of death</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for <i>symbol of death</i>.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.</p>\n      <p><i>Sustained Force:</i> A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.</p>\n      <p>This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.</p>\n      <p>An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks.</p>\n      <p><i>Combat Maneuver:</i> Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis</i> to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</p>\n      <p><i>Violent Thrust:</i> Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p>\n      <p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).</p>\n      <p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

The character's future self is technically only a possible future self (the time stream is a maelstrom of multiple probabilities), but snatching that future self from 1 round in the future collapses probability, and the possible future becomes the definite future. The character and his or her future self are both free to act normally this round (the character has already used up the limit of one quickened spell per round, but his or her duplicate hasn't). The future self has all the resources the character has at the moment he or she finishes casting <i>time duplicate</i>. Because the future self was previously only a possibility, his or her resources are not depleted as a result of whatever might occur this round (even if the character dies this round). Likewise, he or she doesn't have any special knowledge of what might occur during this round. Because the future self is still part of the time stream, the round it spends with the character is a round it misses in its own future. Because the chracter's future duplicate is also the character, the character misses the next round as well. He or she simply isn't there. Tampering with the time stream is a tricky business. Here is a round-by-round summary.</p>\n      <p><i>Round One:</i> The character casts <i>time duplicate</i>, the future self from round two arrives, and both act normally.</p>\n      <p><i>Round Two:</i> The future self-the character-gets snatched back in time to help the past self. During this round, there are no versions of the character present.</p>\n      <p><i>Round Three:</i> The character rejoins the time stream. The character arrives in the same location and condition that the future self ended with at the end of the first round. Any resources (spells, damage, staff charges) the future self used up in round one are gone for real. Record them now. Using this spell to snatch a single future self stretches time and probability to its limit; more powerful versions of <i>time duplicate</i> are not possible. A character cannot bring more than a single future version of him or her self back at one time, nor can a character snatch a version of him or her from farther in the future.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.</p>\n      <p>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed).

Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. <i>Note:</i> An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</li>\n <li> Remove injuries and afflictions. A single <i>Wish</i> can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same <i>wish</i>.

A <i>Wish</i> can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two <i>wishes</i>,  one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A <i>Wish</i> cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.</li>\n <li> Transport travelers.

The <i>Wish</i> forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <i>Wish</i> could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li>\n</ul>\n      <p>You may try to use a <i>Wish</i> to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous.

character's base Leadership score equals his level plus any Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but the character must still be 6th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect a character's Leadership score, as detailed above.</p><p><i>Cohort Level:</i> The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of a character's Leadership score, he can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and alignment. The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to the leader's alignment on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an alignment different from his own.</p><p>Cohorts earn XP as follows:</p><p>The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP.</p><p>Divide the cohort's level by the level of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the Leadership feat who attracted the cohort).</p><p>Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohort's total.</p><p>If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than the associated PC's character level, the cohort does not gain the new level-its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next level.</p><p/><p><i>Number of Followers by Level:</i> The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're generally five or more levels behind the character they follow, they're rarely effective in combat.</p><p>Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. However, when a character with Leadership attains a new level, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which may be higher level than the existing followers. (You don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)</p><p/>\n</div>\n",

Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them as divine inspiration or through their own strength of faith. Each adept must choose a time each day at which she must spend an hour in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether an adept can prepare spells.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, an adept can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Adept.

He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained.

Once he or she has established a sense of the location, the agent retriever can maintain this uncanny link even if the target moves, but only so long as he or she hunts down this person or item to the exclusion of all other pursuits.

The agent retriever can attempt to enclose any creature or object he or she can see within 30 feet. The target is allowed a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + 1/2 the class level of the agent retriever + the agent retriever's Dexterity modifier).

A captured target does not count toward the capacity of the agent retriever's <i>Plane Shift</i> ability, and the agent retriever can plane shift with the target despite the presence of the <i>force sphere</i>.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 7th-level spells before he became an archmage, he must decide to which class he adds each level of archmage for the purpose of determining spells per day.</p>\n</div><div topic='High Arcana' level='8'><p><b>High Arcana:</b> An archmage gains the opportunity to select a special ability from among those described below by permanently eliminating one existing spell slot (she cannot eliminate a spell slot of higher level than the highest-level spell she can cast). Each special ability has a minimum required spell slot level, as specified in its description.</p><p>An archmage may choose to eliminate a spell slot of a higher level than that required to gain a type of high arcana.</p><p><i>Arcane Fire (Su):</i> The archmage gains the ability to change arcane spell energy into arcane fire, manifesting it as a bolt of raw magical energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level of archmage) that deals 1d6 points of damage per class level of the archmage plus 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell used to create the effect. This ability costs one 9th-level spell slot.</p><p><i>Arcane Reach (Su):</i> The archmage can use spells with a range of touch on a target up to 30 feet away. The archmage must make a ranged touch attack. Arcane reach can be selected a second time as a special ability, in which case the range increases to 60 feet. This ability costs one 7th-level spell slot.</p><p><i>Mastery of Counterspelling:</i> When the archmage counterspells a spell, it is turned back upon the caster as if it were fully affected by a <i>spell turning</i> spell. If the spell cannot be affected by <i>spell turning</i>, then it is merely counterspelled. This ability costs one 7th-level spell slot.</p><p><i>Mastery of Elements:</i> The archmage can alter an arcane spell when cast so that it utilizes a different element from the one it normally uses. This ability can only alter a spell with the acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic descriptor. The spell's casting time is unaffected. The caster decides whether to alter the spell's energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins casting. This ability costs one 8th-level spell slot.</p><p><i>Mastery of Shaping:</i> The archmage can alter area and effect spells that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, cylinder, emanation, or spread. The alteration consists of creating spaces within the spell's area or effect that are not subject to the spell. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. Furthermore, any shapeable spells have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 10 feet. This ability costs one 6th-level spell slot.</p><p><i>Spell Power:</i> This ability increases the archmage's effective caster level by +1 (for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables such as damage dice or range, and caster level checks only). This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot.</p><p><i>Spell-Like Ability:</i> An archmage who selects this type of high arcana can use one of her arcane spell slots (other than a slot expended to learn this or any other type of high arcana) to permanently prepare one of her arcane spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The archmage does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so and a spell with a costly material component instead costs her 10 times that amount in XP. This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot.</p><p>The spell-like ability normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level, although the archmage can choose to make a spell modified by a metamagic feat into a spell-like ability at the appropriate spell level.</p><p>The archmage may use an available higher-level spell slot in order to use the spell-like ability more often. Using a slot three levels higher than the chosen spell allows her to use the spell-like ability four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets her use it six times per day.</p><p>If spell-like ability is selected more than one time as a high arcana choice, this ability can apply to the same spell chosen the first time (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

To cast a spell, an assassin must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an assassin with an Intelligence of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Assassin bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the assassin's Intelligence bonus. When the assassin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level.</p><p>The assassin's spell list appears below. An assassin casts spells just as a bard does.</p><p>Upon reaching 6th level, at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), an assassin can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level assassin spell the assassin can cast.

topic='Class Features' level='5'><p><h5><b>Class Features</b></h5></p><p>All of the following are class features of the barbarian.</p><div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>\n</div><div topic='Fast Movement' level='8'><p><b>Fast Movement (Ex):</b> A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.</p>\n</div><div topic='Illiteracy' level='8'><p><b>Illiteracy:</b> Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.</p><p>A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.</p>\n</div><div topic='Rage' level='8'><p><b>Rage (Ex):</b> A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below).</p><p>A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else's action.</p>\n</div><div topic='Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>\n</div><div topic='Trap Sense' level='8'><p><b>Trap Sense (Ex):</b> Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>\n</div><div topic='Improved Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.</p>\n</div><div topic='Damage Reduction' level='8'><p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex):</b> At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>\n</div><div topic='Greater Rage' level='8'><p><b>Greater Rage (Ex):</b> At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.</p>\n</div><div topic='Indomitable Will' level='8'><p><b>Indomitable Will (Ex):</b> While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.</p>\n</div><div topic='Tireless Rage' level='8'><p><b>Tireless Rage (Ex):</b> At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.</p>\n</div><div topic='Mighty Rage' level='8'><p><b>Mighty Rage (Ex):</b> At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4.

level='5'><p><h5><b>Class Features</b></h5></p><p>All of the following are class features of the bard.</p><div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.</p>\n</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><p><b>Spells:</b> A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard's Charisma modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.</p><p>The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)</p><p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard 'loses' the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p><p>As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Bardic Knowledge' level='8'><p><b>Bardic Knowledge:</b> A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)</p><p>A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random.</p><p/><table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td><b>DC</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Type of Knowledge</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>10<br/></td>\n<td>Common, known by at least a substantial minority drinking; common legends of the local population.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>20<br/></td>\n<td>Uncommon but available, known by only a few people legends.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>25<br/></td>\n<td>Obscure, known by few, hard to come by.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>30<br/></td>\n<td>Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don't understand the significance of the knowledge.<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table><p/>\n</div><div topic='Bardic Music' level='8'><p><b>Bardic Music:</b> Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.</p><p>Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn't require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.</p><p><i>Countersong (Su):</i> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself ) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.</p><p><i>Fascinate (Sp):</i> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.</p><p>To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.</p><p>Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. <i>fascinate</i> is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.</p><p><i>Inspire Courage (Su):</i> A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself ), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.</p><p><i>Inspire Competence (Su):</i> A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.</p><p>The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard's music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.</p><p><i>Suggestion (Sp):</i> A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a <i>Suggestion</i> (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the <i>fascinate</i> effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the <i>fascinate</i> effect.</p><p>Making a <i>Suggestion</i> doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see <i>mass suggestion</i>, below). <i>Suggestion</i> is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.</p><p><i>Inspire Greatness (Su):</i> A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.</p><p><i>Song of Freedom (Sp):</i> A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the <i>break enchantment</i> spell (caster level equals the character's bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can't use <i>song of freedom</i> on himself.</p><p><i>Inspire Heroics (Su):</i> A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.</p><p><i>Mass Suggestion (Sp):</i> This ability functions like <i>suggestion</i>,  above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the <i>Suggestion</i> simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated (see above). <i>Mass suggestion</i> is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div><div topic='Ex-Bards' level='5'><p><h5><b>Ex-Bards</b></h5></p><p>A bard who becomes lawful in alignment cannot progress in levels as a bard, though he retains all his bard abilities.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.</p>\n</div><div topic='Aura' level='8'><p><b>Aura (Ex):</b> A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see the <i>detect evil</i> spell for details). Clerics who don't worship a specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.</p>\n</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><p><b>Spells:</b> A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).</p><p>To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's Wisdom modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).</p><p>Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>\n</div><div topic='Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells' level='8'><p><b>Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells:</b> A cleric's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to his deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.</p><p>If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p><p>Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.</p><p>With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.</p>\n</div><div topic='Spontaneous Casting' level='8'><p><b>Spontaneous Casting:</b> A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can 'lose' any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any <i>cure</i> spell of the same spell level or lower (a <i>cure</i> spell is any spell with 'cure' in its name).</p><p>An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can't convert prepared spells to <i>cure</i> spells but can convert them to <i>inflict</i> spells (an <i>inflict</i> spell is one with 'inflict' in its name).</p><p>A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either <i>cure</i> spells or <i>inflict</i> spells (player's choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below).</p>\n</div><div topic='Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells' level='8'><p><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</b> A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n</div><div topic='Turn or Rebuke Undead' level='8'><p><b>Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su):</b> Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).</p><p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous <i>cure</i> or <i>inflict</i> spells (see above).</p><p>A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.

topic='Class Features' level='5'><p><h5><b>Class Features</b></h5></p><p>All of the following are class features of the druid.</p><div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p><p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood</i> spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the <i>ironwood</i> spell description) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.</p><p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>\n</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><p><b>Spells:</b> A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).</p><p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. She does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p><p>A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a <i>cure</i> spell in its place (but see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>\n</div><div topic='Spontaneous Casting' level='8'><p><b>Spontaneous Casting:</b> A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can 'lose' a prepared spell in order to cast any <i>summon nature's ally</i> spell of the same level or lower. <b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</b> A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n</div><div topic='Bonus Languages' level='8'><p><b>Bonus Languages:</b> A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p><p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p><p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>\n</div><div topic='Animal Companion' level='8'><p><b>Animal Companion (Ex):</b> A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.</p><p>A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a druid advances in level, the animal's power increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p><p>A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see below). Should she select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, she can't have that animal as a companion.)</p>\n</div><div topic='Nature Sense' level='8'><p><b>Nature Sense (Ex):</b> A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>\n</div><div topic='Wild Empathy' level='8'><p><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.</p><p>The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p><p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p><p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>\n</div><div topic='Woodland Stride' level='8'><p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.</p>\n</div><div topic='Trackless Step' level='8'><p><b>Trackless Step (Ex):</b> Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>\n</div><div topic='Resist Nature's Lure' level='8'><p><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.</p>\n</div><div topic='Wild Shape' level='8'><p><b>Wild Shape (Su):</b> At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the <i>polymorph</i> spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p>The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p><p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p><p>A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.</p><p>The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level.</p><p>At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can't use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn't a creature.)</p><p>At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type.</p><p>At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.</p>\n</div><div topic='Venom Immunity' level='8'><p><b>Venom Immunity (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>\n</div><div topic='Thousand Faces' level='8'><p><b>A Thousand Faces (Su):</b> At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self</i> spell, but only while in her normal form.</p>\n</div><div topic='Timeless Body' level='8'><p><b>Timeless Body (Ex):</b> After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged.

The druid's class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion's abilities and the alternative lists available to the character.</p><p><i>Bonus HD:</i> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra Hit Dice improve the animal companion's base attack and base save bonuses. An animal companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level equal to the animal's HD. An animal companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). An animal companion gains additional skill points and feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.</p><p><i>Natural Armor Adj.:</i> The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion's existing natural armor bonus.</p><p><i>Str/Dex Adj.:</i> Add this value to the animal companion's Strength and Dexterity scores.</p><p><i>Bonus Tricks:</i> The value given in this column is the total number of 'bonus' tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus tricks don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can't be changed.</p><p><i>Link (Ex):</i> A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.</p><p><i>Share Spells (Ex):</i> At the druid's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself also affect her animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 feet of her at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal companion if the companion moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the animal again, even if it returns to the druid before the duration expires.</p><p>Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of 'You' on her animal companion (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal).</p><p><i>Evasion (Ex):</i> If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.</p><p><i>Devotion (Ex):</i> An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p><p><i>Multiattack:</i> An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty.</p><p><i>Improved Evasion (Ex):</i> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div><div topic='Alternative Animal Companions' level='3'><p><h3>Alternative Animal Companions</h3></p><p>A druid of sufficiently high level can select her animal companion from one of the following lists, applying the indicated adjustment to the druid's level (in parentheses) for purposes of determining the companion's characteristics and special abilities.</p><p/><div topic='4th Level or Higher' level='8'><p><b>4th Level or Higher (Level -3)</b></p>\n</div><div topic='Ape' level='8'><p>Ape (animal)</p><p>Bear, black (animal)</p>\n</div><div topic='Bison' level='8'><p>Bison (animal)</p>\n</div><div topic='Boar' level='8'><p>Boar (animal)</p>\n</div><div topic='Cheetah' level='8'><p>Cheetah (animal)</p><p>Crocodile (animal)<b>1</b></p><p>Dire badger</p><p>Dire bat</p><p>Dire weasel</p>\n</div><div topic='Leopard' level='8'><p>Leopard (animal)</p><p>Lizard, monitor (animal)</p><p>Shark, Large<b>1</b> (animal)</p><p>Snake, constrictor (animal)</p>\n</div><div topic='Snake, Large Viper' level='8'><p>Snake, Large viper (animal)</p>\n</div><div topic='Wolverine' level='8'><p>Wolverine (animal)</p><p/>\n</div><div topic='7th Level or Higher' level='8'><p><b>7th Level or Higher (Level -6)</b></p><p>Bear, brown (animal)</p><p>Dire wolverine</p><p>Crocodile, giant (animal)</p>\n</div><div topic='Deinonychus' level='8'><p>Deinonychus (dinosaur)</p><p>Dire ape</p><p>Dire boar</p><p>Dire wolf</p><p>Elasmosaurus<b>1</b> (dinosaur)</p>\n</div><div topic='Lion' level='8'><p>Lion (animal)</p>\n</div><div topic='Rhinoceros' level='8'><p>Rhinoceros (animal)</p>\n</div><div topic='Snake, Huge Viper' level='8'><p>Snake, Huge viper (animal)</p>\n</div><div topic='Tiger' level='8'><p>Tiger (animal)</p><p/>\n</div><div topic='10th Level or Higher' level='8'><p><b>10th Level or Higher (Level -9)</b></p><p>Bear, polar (animal)</p><p>Dire lion</p>\n</div><div topic='Megaraptor' level='8'><p>Megaraptor (dinosaur)</p><p>Shark, Huge<b>1</b> (animal)</p><p>Snake, giant constrictor (animal)</p><p>Whale, orca<b>1</b> (animal)</p><p/>\n</div><div topic='13th Level or Higher' level='8'><p><b>13th Level or Higher (Level -12)</b></p><p>Dire bear</p>\n</div><div topic='Elephant' level='8'><p>Elephant (animal)</p><p>Octopus, giant<b>1</b> (animal)</p><p/>\n</div><div topic='16th Level or Higher' level='8'><p><b>16th Level or Higher (Level -15)</b></p><p>Dire shark<b>1</b> </p><p>Dire tiger</p><p>Squid, giant<b>1</b> (animal)</p>\n</div><div topic='Triceratops' level='8'><p>Triceratops (dinosaur)</p>\n</div><div topic='Tyrannosaurus' level='8'><p>Tyrannosaurus (dinosaur)</p><p/><p>1 Available only in an aquatic environment.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see Table: The Dwarven Defender). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action.</p>\n</div><div topic='Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a dwarven defender retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)</p><p>If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).</p>\n</div><div topic='Trap Sense' level='8'><p><b>Trap Sense (Ex):</b> At 4th level, a dwarven defender gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 8th level, these bonuses rise to +2. These bonuses stack with trap sense bonuses gained from other classes.</p>\n</div><div topic='Damage Reduction' level='8'><p><b>Damage Reduction (Ex):</b> At 6th level, a dwarven defender gains damage reduction. Subtract 3 points from the damage the dwarven defender takes each time he is dealt damage. At 10th level, this damage reduction rises to 6/-. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>\n</div><div topic='Improved Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> At 6th level, a dwarven defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the dwarven defender.</p><p>The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the dwarven defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).</p><p>If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>\n</div><div topic='Mobile Defense' level='8'><p><b>Mobile Defense (Ex):</b> At 8th level, a dwarven defender can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit of the stance.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of elocater to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.</p><p>If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became an elocater, she must decide to which class she adds the new level of elocater for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Scorn Earth' level='8'><p><b>Scorn Earth (Su):</b> At 1st level, an elocater's feet lift from the ground. From now on, she can float a foot above the ground. Instead of walking she glides along, unconcerned with the hard earth or difficult terrain. While she remains within 1 foot of a flat surface of any solid or liquid, she can take normal actions and make normal attacks, and can move at her normal speed (she can even 'run' at four times her normal speed). However, at distances higher than 1 foot above any surface, her speed diminishes to 10 feet per round.</p><p>While she remains within 1 foot of a surface, she can make melee and ranged attacks normally, but if she moves any higher, she incurs the penalties on melee and ranged attack rolls as if she were the subject of the <i>psionic levitate</i> power.</p>\n</div><div topic='Sidestep Charge' level='8'><p><b>Sidestep Charge (Ex):</b> At 1st level, an elocater gains Sidestep Charge as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. If the character already has this feat, she gains no benefit.</p>\n</div><div topic='Opportunistic Strike' level='8'><p><b>Opportunistic Strike (Ex):</b> Beginning at 2nd level, an elocater's hyperawareness of spatial relations gives her an instinctive view of the battlefield, which allows her to make a cunning attack against distracted opponents. The elocater gains a +2 insight bonus on her attack roll and her damage roll (if the attack hits) for the first attack she makes against an opponent that has been dealt damage in melee by another character since the elocater's last action. At 5th level the insight bonus increases to +4, and at 8th level the insight bonus increases to +6.</p>\n</div><div topic='Dimension Step' level='8'><p><b>Dimension Step (Su):</b> An elocater of 3rd level or higher can slip psionically between spaces as if using the <i>psionic dimension door</i> power, once per day. The elocater cannot bring any other creatures with her. Her manifester level for this effect is equal to her elocater level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Flanker' level='8'><p><b>Flanker (Ex):</b> An elocater of 4th level or higher can flank enemies from seemingly impossible angles. She can designate any adjacent square as the square from which flanking against an ally is determined (including the square where she stands, as normal). She can designate the square at the beginning of her turn or at any time during her turn. The designated square remains her effective square for flanking until she is no longer adjacent to it or until she chooses a different square (at the start of one of her turns). The character can even choose a square that is impassable or occupied.</p>\n</div><div topic='Transporter' level='8'><p><b>Transporter (Ex):</b> At 6th level, an elocater learns both <i>psionic teleport</i> and <i>psionic plane shift</i>. These powers are in addition to any powers the elocater normally learns by advancing a level.</p><p>The elocater treats these powers as if they were 3rd-level powers on her class list. This means, among other things, that manifesting these powers costs 5 power points. (If the character does not have a high enough manifester level to manifest 3rd-level powers the character cannot manifest these powers until she has attained the required manifester level.)</p>\n</div><div topic='Capricious Step' level='8'><p><b>Capricious Step (Ex):</b> At 7th level, an elocater can take an extra 5-foot step in any round when she doesn't perform any other movement (except for the first 5-foot step). Like the first, the second 5-foot step does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The character can take the extra 5-foot step immediately after taking the first, or wait until the end of her other actions for the round. In all other ways, the rules for taking a 5-foot step apply.</p>\n</div><div topic='Dimension Spring Attack' level='8'><p><b>Dimension Spring Attack (Su):</b> An elocater of 9th level or higher can use her dimension step ability in conjunction with her Spring Attack feat once per day. This ability can be used only against opponents within 60 feet to which the elocater has line of sight. She can dimension step up to the target, use Spring Attack, and then use dimension step to return to her starting point. (When she uses this ability, the total distance she can travel before and after the attack is not limited by her speed.) The use of this ability counts as her use of the dimension step ability on that day (and this ability is not available during a day when she has already used dimension step).</p>\n</div><div topic='Accelerated Action' level='8'><p><b>Accelerated Action (Su):</b> When she attains 10th level, an elocater can accelerate herself and thereby take more actions than normal. An elocater can accelerate herself for a total of 5 rounds per day. She can choose to parcel out her accelerated actions in 1-round increments. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects that provide additional actions, such as <i>schism</i> or a <i>haste</i> spell-and in fact an elocater can't take an accelerated action if affected by these or similar effects.)</p><p>If she makes a full attack while accelerated, an elocater can make one extra attack with any weapon she is holding. The attack is made using her full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. If the elocater uses her accelerated action to move, she gains an enhancement bonus to her speed of +30 feet. The elocater can use her accelerated action to manifest a power, as long as she has not already manifested a power in the current round and the one she wants to manifest has a manifesting time of 1 standard action or shorter. While accelerated, she gains a +2 dodge bonus on attack rolls and Reflex saves and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Any condition that makes her lose her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes her lose these dodge bonuses.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

While operating in a cover identity, the epic infiltra-tor gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks. When the epic infiltrator has the option of adding a new cover identity, he or she may instead work on further perfecting a cover identity already possessed. An improved cover identity grants a +6 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks while operating in that identity. A specific cover identity may be improved multiple times, each time adding +2 to the bonuses. It is impossible to detect the epic infiltrator's alignment with any form of divination. This ability functions exactly like an <i>undetectable alignment</i> spell, except that it is always active as a supernatural ability. Only divinations are confounded; spells that function only against certain alignments affect the epic infiltrator normally. Should the epic infiltrator wish to 'retire' a cover identity and develop a new one, he or she must spend one week practicing the new identity before he or she earns the bonuses. Cover identities do not in themselves provide the epic infiltrator with additional skills, proficiencies, or class features that others might expect of the pretended professions. The epic infiltrator can switch cover identities or don a disguise using the Disguise skill in 1d3 minutes. He or she can also put on or take off armor in one-half the normal time.</p>\n</div><div topic='Sneak Attack' level='8'><p><b>Sneak Attack:</b> If an epic infiltrator can catch an opponent when the opponent is unable to defend effectively from his or her attack, he or she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the epic infiltrator's target would be denied his or her Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he or she actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the epic infiltrator's attack deals +1d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by +1d6 points every three levels. Should the epic infiltrator score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is 30 feet away or less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, the epic infiltrator can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal damage. He or she cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty. An epic infiltrator can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the epic infiltrator must also be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. The epic infiltrator cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If an epic infiltrator gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses to damage stack.</p>\n</div><div topic='Specialist Training' level='8'><p><b>Specialist Training (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, the epic infiltrator gains the benefit of focusing his or her craft on a particular type of work, specializing in one of the following categories and receiving a +3 bonus on all checks with the listed skills. Every three levels thereafter, the epic infiltrator gains specialist training again. He or she may select the same category more than once.</p><p><i>Concealment:</i> Bluff, Disguise, and Forgery.</p><p><i>Subterfuge:</i> Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, and Pick Pocket.</p><p><i>Espionage:</i> Listen, Search, and Spot.</p><p><i>Interaction:</i> Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Sense Motive.</p>\n</div><div topic='Read Thoughts' level='8'><p><b>Read Thoughts (Su):</b> Beginning at 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can <i>detect thoughts</i> as the spell cast by a 15th-level caster, except that it targets a single mind. Every four levels thereafter, the epic infiltrator can per-form this ability one additional time per day.</p>\n</div><div topic='Far Senses' level='8'><p><b>Far Senses (Su):</b> Starting at 4th level, the epic infiltrator can extend his or her vision or hearing into an area beyond his or her normal range, once per day, to a distance of 20 feet plus an additional 20 feet per epic infiltrator level. The epic infiltrator must have personally visited the physical location earlier to use far senses on it. Barriers do not impede far senses, and low-light vision or darkvision function normally if the epic infiltrator has one or both of those abilities. Far senses can also apply to the epic infiltrator's read thoughts ability. Every two levels beyond 4th the epic infiltrator can perform this ability one additional time per day. This ability functions as the <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i> spell cast by a 15th-level caster, except for the limit on range, the need to know the locale beforehand, and the ability to use the read thoughts ability.</p>\n</div><div topic='Mind Blank' level='8'><p><b><i>Mind Blank</i> (Sp):</b> At 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can become immune to all mind-affecting spells and divinations once per day, plus one additional time per day every eight levels thereafter. This ability works as the <i>Mind Blank</i> spell cast by a 15th-level caster.</p><p/><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

It is possible that the character has higher-level aspects of the uncanny dodge ability. Whatever the level of uncanny dodge attained by the character, the guardian paramount can extend the features of his or her uncanny dodge ability to include any one creature he or she designates within 5 feet of him or her (he or she can designate a creature or change designations as a free action once per round). The guardian paramount can extend his or her uncanny dodge ability three times per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter.</p>\n</div><div topic='Evasive Preceptor' level='8'><p><b>Evasive Preceptor (Ex):</b> The guardian paramount must have the evasion class feature, which allows the character to take no damage from an area attack with a successful Reflex save.

When a guardian paramount creates a <i>protective aura</i>, the transferred wounds are dealt to the guardian paramount as subdual damage, not normal damage, as with the <i>shield other</i> spell. Otherwise, the guardian paramount's <i>Protective Aura</i> functions like the <i>shield other spell</i> cast by an 8th-level cleric.</p>\n</div><div topic='Adjust Probability' level='8'><p><b>Adjust Probability (Ex):</b> On reaching 5th level, the guardian paramount gains the ability to affect probability twice per day, plus one additional time per day per three levels thereafter. The guardian paramount can force a reroll of one attack roll, check, or saving throw that another creature within 25 feet-friend or enemy-just made. The guardian paramount can find out whether the attack roll, check, or save would have succeeded before using this ability.

(See the table below for a list of which alignments are opposed to each alignment.) Any spell with a description that involves inflicting or channeling negative energy cast on a creature of the opposed alignment works as if under the effect of a Maximize Spell feat (without using a higher-level spell slot).

If the spell requires a melee touch attack, the hierophant must make a ranged touch attack instead. Divine reach can be selected a second time as a special ability, in which case the range increases to 60 feet.</p><p><i>Faith Healing (Su):</i> A hierophant can use healing spells to their maximum effect on creatures of the same alignment as the hierophant (including the hierophant himself ). Any spell with the healing descriptor cast on such creatures works as if under the effects of a Maximize Spell feat (without using a higher-level spell slot).</p><p><i>Gift of the Divine (Su):</i> Available only to hierophants with cleric levels, this ability allows a hierophant to transfer one or more uses of his turn undead ability to a willing creature. (Hierophants who rebuke undead transfer uses of rebuke undead instead.) The transfer lasts anywhere from 24 hours to one week (chosen at the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the number of turning attempts per day allowed to the hierophant is reduced by the number transferred. The recipient turns undead as a cleric of the hierophant's cleric level but uses her own Charisma modifier.</p><p><i>Mastery of Energy (Su):</i> Available only to hierophants with cleric levels, this ability allows a hierophant to channel positive or negative energy much more effectively, increasing his ability to affect undead. Add a +4 bonus to the hierophant's turning checks and turning damage rolls. This ability only affects undead, even if the hierophant can turn other creatures, such as with a granted power of a domain.</p><p><i>Metamagic Feat:</i> A hierophant can choose a metamagic feat in place of one of the special abilities described here if desired.</p><p><i>Power of Nature (Su):</i> Available only to hierophants with druid levels, this ability allows a hierophant to temporarily transfer one or more of his druid Class Features to a willing creature. The transfer lasts anywhere from 24 hours to one week (chosen at the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the hierophant cannot use the transferred power. He can transfer any of his druid powers except spellcasting and the ability to have an animal companion.</p><p>The druid's wild shape ability can be partially or completely transferred. The heirophant choses how many uses of wild shape per day to give to transfer and retains the rest of the uses for himself. If the hierophant can assume the form of Tiny or Huge animals, the recipient can as well.</p><p>As with the <i>imbue with spell ability</i> spell, the hierophant remains responsible to his deity for any use to which the recipient puts the transferred abilities.</p><p><i>Spell Power:</i> This special ability increases a hierophant's effective caster level by 1 for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables and for caster level checks. This ability can be selected more than once, and changes to effective caster level are cumulative.</p><p><i>Spell-Like Ability:</i> A hierophant who selects this special ability can use one of his divine spell slots to permanently prepare one of his divine spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The hierophant does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so, and a spell with a costly material component instead costs him 10 times that amount in XP.</p><p>The spell normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level (or higher, if the hierophant chooses to permanently attach a metamagic feat to the spell chosen). The hierophant can use an available higher-level spell slot to use the spell-like ability more than once per day. Allocating a slot three levels higher allows him to cast the spell four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets him cast it six times per day. If selected more than one time as a special ability, this ability can apply to the same spell (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).</p><p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.</p>\n</div><div topic='Flurry of Blows' level='8'><p><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex):</b> When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.</p><p>When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus x 1-1/2 or x1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.</p><p>In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so.</p><p>When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.</p>\n</div><div topic='Unarmed Strike' level='8'><p><b>Unarmed Strike:</b> At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.</p><p>Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.</p><p>A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.</p><p>A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.</p><p/><table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'>\n\n<tr maxcol='4' curcol='2'>\n<td colspan='3'><b>Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage</b><br/></td> \n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'>\n<td><b>Level</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Damage</b><br/>\n (<b>Small Monk)</b><br/></td> <td><b>Damage</b><br/>\n<b>(Large Monk)</b><br/></td> \n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'>\n<td>1st-3rd<br/></td>\n<td>1d4<br/></td>\n<td>1d8<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'>\n<td>4th-7th<br/></td>\n<td>1d6<br/></td>\n<td>2d6<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'>\n<td>8th-11th<br/></td>\n<td>1d8<br/></td>\n<td>2d8<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'>\n<td>12th-15th<br/></td>\n<td>1d10<br/></td>\n<td>3d6<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'>\n<td>16th-19th<br/></td>\n<td>2d6<br/></td>\n<td>3d8<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'>\n<td>20th<br/></td>\n<td>2d8<br/></td>\n<td>4d8<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table><p/>\n</div><div topic='Bonus Feat' level='8'><p><b>Bonus Feat:</b> At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</p>\n</div><div topic='Evasion' level='8'><p><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>\n</div><div topic='Fast Movement' level='8'><p><b>Fast Movement (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>\n</div><div topic='Still Mind' level='8'><p><b>Still Mind (Ex):</b> A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.</p>\n</div><div topic='Ki Strike' level='8'><p><b><i>Ki</i> Strike (Su):</b> At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with <i>ki</i>. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. <i>Ki</i> strike improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>\n</div><div topic='Slow Fall' level='8'><p><b>Slow Fall (Ex):</b> At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm.</p>\n</div><div topic='Purity of Body' level='8'><p><b>Purity of Body (Ex):</b> At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.</p>\n</div><div topic='Wholeness of Body' level='8'><p><b>Wholeness of Body (Su):</b> At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.</p>\n</div><div topic='Improved Evasion' level='8'><p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p>\n</div><div topic='Diamond Body' level='8'><p><b>Diamond Body (Su):</b> At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.</p>\n</div><div topic='Abundant Step' level='8'><p><b>Abundant Step (Su):</b> At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell <i>dimension door</i>,  once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).</p>\n</div><div topic='Diamond Soul' level='8'><p><b>Diamond Soul (Ex):</b> At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.</p>\n</div><div topic='Quivering Palm' level='8'><p><b>Quivering Palm (Su):</b> Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.</p>\n</div><div topic='Timeless Body' level='8'><p><b>Timeless Body (Ex):</b> Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.</p>\n</div><div topic='Tongue of the Sun and Moon' level='8'><p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex):</b> A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.</p>\n</div><div topic='Empty Body' level='8'><p><b>Empty Body (Su):</b> At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell <i>etherealness</i>. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Perfect Self' level='8'><p><b>Perfect Self:</b> At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div><div topic='Ex-Monks' level='5'><p><h5><b>Ex-Monks</b></h5></p><p>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.</p><p>Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character, but multiclass monks face a special restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.</p><p>At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Divine Grace' level='8'><p><b>Divine Grace (Su):</b> At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>\n</div><div topic='Lay on Hands' level='8'><p><b>Lay on Hands (Su):</b> Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action.</p><p>Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.</p>\n</div><div topic='Aura of Courage' level='8'><p><b>Aura of Courage (Su):</b> Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise).

A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p><p>To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin's Wisdom modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level The paladin does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p><p>A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to spontaneously cast a <i>cure</i> spell in its place. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p><p>Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Special Mount' level='8'><p><b><i>Special Mount</i> (Sp):</b> Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil (see below). This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).</p><p>Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a particular mount from service.</p><p>Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect.</p><p>Should the paladin's mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead.

She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the <i>atonement</i> spell description), as appropriate.</p><p>Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass character, but multiclass paladins face a special restriction.

Another kind of mount, such as a riding dog (for a halfling paladin) or a Large shark (for a paladin in an aquatic campaign) may be allowed as well.</p><p>A paladin's mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects that depend on its type (though it retains an animal's HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).</p><p/><table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'>\n\n<tr maxcol='7' curcol='7'>\n<td><b>Paladin Level</b> <br/></td> <td><b>Bonus HD</b> <br/></td>\n<td><b>Natural Armor Adj</b>. <br/></td>\n<td><b>Str Adj</b>. <br/></td>\n<td><b>Int</b> <br/></td>\n<td><b>Special</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='7' curcol='7'>\n<td>5th-7th<br/></td>\n<td>+2<br/></td>\n<td>+4<br/></td>\n<td>+1<br/></td>\n<td>6<br/></td>\n<td>Empathic link, improved evasion, share spells, share saving throws<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='7' curcol='7'>\n<td>8th-10th<br/></td>\n<td>+4<br/></td>\n<td>+6<br/></td>\n<td>+2<br/></td>\n<td>7<br/></td>\n<td>Improved speed<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='7' curcol='7'>\n<td>11th-14th<br/></td>\n<td>+6<br/></td>\n<td>+8<br/></td>\n<td>+3<br/></td>\n<td>8<br/></td>\n<td><i>Command</i> creatures of its kind<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='7' curcol='7'>\n<td>15th-20th<br/></td>\n<td>+8<br/></td>\n<td>+10<br/></td>\n<td>+4<br/></td>\n<td>9<br/></td>\n<td>Spell resistance<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table><p/><div topic='Paladin's Mount Basics' level='8'><p><b>Paladin's Mount Basics:</b> Use the base statistics for a creature of the mount's kind, but make changes to take into account the attributes and characteristics summarized on the table and described below.</p><p><i>Bonus HD:</i> Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount's base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount's base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount's HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice.</p><p><i>Natural Armor Adj.:</i> The number on the table is an improvement to the mount's existing natural armor bonus.</p><p><i>Str Adj.:</i> Add this figure to the mount's Strength score.</p><p><i>Int:</i> The mount's Intelligence score.</p><p><i>Empathic Link (Su):</i> The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount's eyes, but they can communicate empathically.</p><p>Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible.</p><p>Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his familiar (see Familiars).</p><p><i>Improved Evasion (Ex):</i> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.</p><p><i>Share Spells:</i> At the paladin's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount.</p><p>The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of 'You' on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount's type (magical beast).</p><p><i>Share Saving Throws:</i> For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the paladin's, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have.</p><p><i>Improved Speed (Ex):</i> The mount's speed increases by 10 feet.</p><p><i>Command (Sp):</i> Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this ability to command other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like the <i>Command</i> spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Concentration check to succeed if it's being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount's daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin's level + paladin's Cha modifier) to negate the effect.</p><p><i>Spell Resistance (Ex):</i> A mount's spell resistance equals its master's paladin level + 5. To affect the mount with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the mount's spell resistance.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

Alternatively, the perfect wight can use improved legerdemain to make one melee sneak attack against any creature within 30 feet. The perfect wight executes the sneak attack (or death attack, if applicable) as if attacking from a flanking position.

As an incorporeal creature, the perfect wight can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. He or she is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, the perfect wight has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). An incorporeal perfect wight has no natural armor but has a deflection bonus equal to his or her Charisma modifier (always at least +1, even if his or her Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus). An incorporeal perfect wight can pass through solid objects at will, but not force effects. His or her attack ignores natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against it. An incorporeal perfect wight moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if he or she doesn't wish to be.

The perfect wight can also use the substance of his or her own shadow to enhance his or her effective level on any attack roll, check, or saving throw.

following are class features of the psion.</p><div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Psions are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, quarterstaff, and shortspear. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor does not, however, interfere with the manifestation of powers.</p>\n</div><div topic='Power Points/Day' level='8'><p><b>Power Points/Day:</b> A psion's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Psion. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.</p>\n</div><div topic='Discipline' level='8'><p><b>Discipline:</b> Every psion must decide at 1st level which psionic discipline he will specialize in. Choosing a discipline provides a psion with access to the class skills associated with that discipline (see above), as well as the powers restricted to that discipline. However, choosing a discipline also means that the psion cannot learn powers that are restricted to other disciplines. He can't even use such powers by employing psionic items.</p>\n</div><div topic='Powers Known' level='8'><p><b>Powers Known:</b> A psion begins play knowing three psion powers of your choice. Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of new powers.</p><p>Choose the powers known from the psion power list, or from the list of powers of your chosen discipline. You cannot choose powers from restricted discipline lists other than your own discipline list. You can choose powers from disciplines other than your own if they are not on a restricted discipline list. (<i>Exception:</i> The feats Expanded Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge do allow a psion to learn powers from the lists of other disciplines or even other classes.) A psion can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level.</p><p>The number of times a psion can manifest powers in a day is limited only by his daily power points.</p><p>A psion simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent power points.</p>\n</div><div topic='Maximum Power Level Known' level='8'><p>The Difficulty Class for saving throws against psion powers is 10 + the power's level + the psion's Intelligence modifier. <b>Maximum Power Level Known:</b> A psion begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains higher levels, a psion may gain the ability to master more complex powers.</p><p>To learn or manifest a power, a psion must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power's level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Bonus Feats' level='8'><p><b>Bonus Feats:</b> A psion gains a bonus feat at 1st level, 5th level, 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level. This feat must be a psionic feat, a metapsionic feat, or a psionic item creation feat.</p><p>These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels. A psion is not limited to psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats when choosing these other feats.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div><div topic='Psionic Disciplines' level='3'><p><h3>Psionic Disciplines</h3></p><p>A discipline is one of six groupings of powers, each defined by a common theme. The six disciplines are clairsentience, metacreativity, psychokinesis, psychometabolism, psychoportation, and telepathy.</p><div topic='Clairsentience' level='8'><p><b>Clairsentience:</b> A psion who chooses clairsentience is known as a seer. Seers can learn precognitive powers to aid their comrades in combat, as well as powers that permit them to gather information in many different ways.</p>\n</div><div topic='Metacreativity' level='8'><p><b>Metacreativity:</b> A psion specializing in metacreativity is known as a shaper. This discipline includes powers that draw ectoplasm or matter from the Astral Plane, creating semisolid and solid items such as armor, weapons, or animated constructs to do battle at the shaper's command.</p>\n</div><div topic='Psychokinesis' level='8'><p><b>Psychokinesis:</b> Psions who specialize in psychokinesis are known as kineticists. They are the masters of powers that manipulate and transform matter and energy. Kineticists can attack with devastating blasts of energy.</p>\n</div><div topic='Psychometabolism' level='8'><p><b>Psychometabolism:</b> A psion who specializes in psychometabolism is known as an egoist. This discipline consists of powers that alter the psion's psychobiology, or that of creatures near him. An egoist can both heal and transform himself into a fearsome fighter.</p>\n</div><div topic='Psychoportation' level='8'><p><b>Psychoportation:</b> A psion who relies on psychoportation powers is known as a nomad. Nomads can wield powers that propel or displace objects in space or time.</p>\n</div><div topic='Telepathy' level='8'><p><b>Telepathy:</b> A psion who chooses the discipline of telepathy is known as a telepath. He is the master of powers that allow mental contact and control of other sentient creatures. A telepath can deceive or destroy the minds of his enemies with ease.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div><div topic='Psicrystals' level='3'><p><h3>Psicrystals</h3></p><p>A psicrystal is a fragment of a psionic character's personality, brought into physical form and a semblance of life (via the Psicrystal Affinity feat). A psicrystal appears as a crystalline construct about the size of a human hand.</p><p>Because it is an extension of its creator's personality, a character's psicrystal is in some ways a part of him. That's why, for example, a psionic character can manifest a personal range power on his psicrystal even though normally he can manifest such a power only on himself.</p><p>A psicrystal is treated as a construct for the purposes of all effects that depend on its type.</p><p>A psicrystal grants special abilities to its owner, as shown on the Psicrystal Special Abilities table below. In addition, a psicrystal has a personality (being a fragment of the owner's personality), which gives its owner a bonus on certain types of checks or saving throws, as given on the Psicrystal Personalities table below. These special abilities and bonuses apply only when the owner and the psicrystal are within 1 mile of each other.</p><p>Psicrystal abilities are based on the owner's levels in psionic classes. Levels from other classes do not count toward the owner's level for purposes of psicrystal abilities.</p><p>A psicrystal can speak one language of its owner's choice (so long as it is a language the owner knows). A psicrystal can understand all other languages known by its owner, but cannot speak them. This is a supernatural ability.</p><div topic='Psicrystal Basics' level='8'><p><b>Psicrystal Basics:</b> Use the statistics for a psicrystal, but make the following changes.</p><p><i>Saving Throws:</i> A psicrystal uses its owner's base saving throw bonuses and ability modifiers on saves, though it doesn't enjoy any other bonuses its owner might have (from magic items or feats, for example).</p><p><i>Abilities:</i> When its self-propulsion ability is not activated, a psicrystal has no Strength score and no Dexterity score.</p><p><i>Skills:</i> A psicrystal has the same skill ranks as its owner, except that it has a minimum of 4 ranks each in Spot, Listen, Move Silently, and Search. (Even if its owner has no ranks in these skills, a psicrystal has 4 ranks in each.)

The abilities on the table are cumulative.</p><p><i>Natural Armor Adj. (Ex):</i> This number noted here is an improvement to the psicrystal's natural armor bonus (normally 0). It represents a psicrystal's preternatural durability.</p><p><i>Intelligence Adj. (Ex):</i> Add this value to the psicrystal's Intelligence score. Psicrystals are as smart as people (though not necessarily as smart as smart people).</p><p><i>Alertness (Ex):</i> The presence of a psicrystal sharpens its master's senses. While a psicrystal is within arm's reach (adjacent to or in the same square as its owner), its owner gains the Alertness feat.</p><p><i>Improved Evasion (Ex):</i> If a psicrystal is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.</p><p><i>Personality (Ex):</i> Every psicrystal has a personality. See Psicrystal Personality, below.</p><p><i>Self-Propulsion (Su):</i> As a standard action, its owner can will a psicrystal to form spidery, ectoplasmic legs that grant the psicrystal a land speed of 30 feet and a climb speed of 20 feet. The legs fade into nothingness after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires).</p><p><i>Share Powers (Su):</i> At the owner's option, he can have any power (but not any psi-like ability) he manifests on himself also affect his psicrystal. The psicrystal must be within 5 feet of him at the time of the manifestation to receive the benefit. If the power has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the psicrystal if it moves farther than 5 feet away, and will not affect the psicrystal again, even if it returns to its owner before the duration expires.</p><p>Additionally, the owner can manifest a power with a target of 'You' on his psicrystal (as a touch range power) instead of on himself. The owner and psicrystal cannot share powers if the powers normally do not affect creatures of the psicrystal's type (construct).</p><p><i>Sighted (Ex):</i> Although it has no physical sensory organs, a psicrystal can telepathically sense its environment as well as a creature with normal vision and hearing. Darkness (even supernatural darkness) is irrelevant, as are areas of supernatural silence, though a psicrystal still can't discern invisible or ethereal beings. A psicrystal's sighted range is 40 feet.</p><p><i>Telepathic Link (Su):</i> The owner has a telepathic link with his psicrystal out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The owner cannot see through the psicrystal's senses, but the two of them can communicate telepathically as if the psicrystal were the target of a <i>mindlink</i> power manifested by the owner. For instance, a psicrystal placed in a distant room could relay the activities occurring in that room.</p><p>Because of the telepathic link between a psicrystal and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item or place that the psicrystal does. For instance, if his psicrystal has seen a room, the owner can teleport into that room as if he has seen it too.</p><p><i>Deliver Touch Powers (Su):</i> If the owner is 3rd level or higher, his psicrystal can deliver touch powers for him. If the owner and psicrystal are in contact at the time the owner manifests a touch power, he can designate his psicrystal as the 'toucher.' The psicrystal can then deliver the touch power just as the owner could. As usual, if the owner manifests another power before the touch is delivered, the touch power dissipates.</p><p><i>Telepathic Speech (Ex):</i> If the owner is 5th level or higher, the psicrystal can communicate telepathically with any creature that has a language and is within 30 feet of the psicrystal, while the psicrystal is also within 1 mile of the owner.</p><p><i>Flight (Su):</i> If the owner is 9th level or higher, he can, as a standard action, will his psicrystal to fly at a speed of 50 feet (poor). The psicrystal drifts gently to the ground after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires).</p><p><i>Power Resistance (Ex):</i> If the owner is 11th level or higher, the psicrystal gains power resistance equal to the owner's level + 5. To affect the psicrystal with a power, another manifester must get a result on a manifester level check that equals or exceeds the psicrystal's power resistance.</p><p><i>Sight Link (Sp):</i> If the owner is 13th level or higher, the character can remote view the psicrystal (as if manifesting the <i>remote view</i> power) once per day.</p><p><i>Channel Power (Sp):</i> If the owner is 15th level or higher, he can manifest powers through the psicrystal to a distance of up to 1 mile. The psicrystal is treated as the power's originator, and all ranges are calculated from its location.</p><p>When channeling a power through his psicrystal, the owner manifests the power by paying its power point cost. He is still subject to attacks of opportunity and other hazards of manifesting a power, if applicable (for instance, he becomes visible when manifesting an offensive power if <i>invisible</i>, as does the psicrystal).</p><p/>\n</div><div topic='Psicrystal Personality' level='8'><p><b>Psicrystal Personality (Ex):</b> Each psicrystal has a distinct personality, chosen by its owner at the time of its creation from among those given on the following table. At 1st level, its owner typically gets a feel for a psicrystal's personality only through occasional impulses, but as the owner increases in level the psicrystal's personality becomes more pronounced. At higher levels, it is not uncommon for a psicrystal to constantly ply its owner with observations and advice, often severely slanted toward the psicrystal's particular worldview.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of psion uncarnate to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.</p><p>If a character had more than one manifesting class before he became a psion uncarnate, he must decide to which class he adds the new level of psion uncarnate for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Incorporeal Touch' level='8'><p><b>Incorporeal Touch (Su):</b> Beginning at 1st level, a psion uncarnate can make up to three melee touch attacks per day that each deal 1d6 points of damage if they hit. The character's Strength modifier is not applied to this attack, but it is effective against incorporeal creatures (and against corporeal creatures while the psion uncarnate is incorporeal) The character's hand and arm seem to become slightly translucent when he makes these attacks. A miss still counts as a use of the ability.</p><p>While uncarnate (see below), a psion uncarnate can make melee touch attacks at will that do not count against his uses of this ability.</p><p>For every four levels higher than 1st the psion uncarnate attains, the damage on these attacks increases by 1d6 points.</p>\n</div><div topic='Uncarnate Armor' level='8'><p><b>Uncarnate Armor (Su):</b> A psion uncarnate wearing armor (or using <i>inertial armor</i> or a similar effect) gets his armor bonus to AC even when he becomes incorporeal (see Shed Body, below). However, unlike other incorporeal creatures, a psion uncarnate does not gain a deflection bonus to Armor Class from his Charisma modifier. This ability works even if the armor being worn becomes incorporeal (such as through the use of the assume equipment ability described below).</p>\n</div><div topic='Shed Body' level='8'><p><b>Shed Body (Su):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a psion uncarnate can become incorporeal (or 'uncarnate') once per day as a standard action. The character can remain uncarnate for up to 1 minute. During this time, the character's body fades into an immaterial form that retains the character's basic likeness. While uncarnate, the character gains the incorporeal subtype (see below). He gains a fly speed equal to his land speed (perfect maneuverability). His material armor remains in place and continues to provide its armor bonus to AC (see Uncarnate Armor, above). His material weapons also remain corporeal. Losing his physical form allows the character to more easily access his mental abilities, and he gains a +1 bonus on all save DCs for powers he manifests while uncarnate.</p><p>He can use equipment normally, deriving benefits from items that enhance his capabilities; however, all his equipment remains material even when the character is uncarnate (but see the assume equipment ability, described below).</p><p>Often, a psion uncarnate appears almost like a ghost wearing items of the material world. This doesn't make his equipment more susceptible to attack (the normal rules for attended objects apply), but it does make it impossible for the character to enter or pass through solid objects while wearing solid equipment. If he drops his material equipment, he can pass through solid objects at will as described below.</p><p>At 6th level and higher, a psion uncarnate can shed his body twice per day for up to 1 minute each time.</p><p><i>Incorporeal Subtype:</i> An incorporeal psion uncarnate has no physical body. He can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. He is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, he has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects,  or attacks made with <i>ghost touch</i> weapons).</p><p>An incorporeal psion uncarnate has no natural armor bonus-and, unlike other incorporeal creatures, does not gain a deflection bonus from his Charisma modifier. An incorporeal psion uncarnate can enter or pass through solid objects (subject to the restrictions described in the shed body and assume equipment abilities), but must remain adjacent to the object's exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than his own. He can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to his current location, but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal psion uncarnate that is inside an object. To see farther from the object he is in and attack normally, the incorporeal psion uncarnate must emerge. An incorporeal psion uncarnate inside an object has total cover, but when he attacks a creature outside the object he only has cover, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at him as he attacks. An incorporeal psion uncarnate cannot pass through a force effect.</p><p>An incorporeal psion uncarnate's attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against him. He can pass through and operate in water as easily as he does in air. An incorporeal psion uncarnate cannot fall or take falling damage. He cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can he be tripped or grappled. In fact, he cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor is he subject to such actions.</p><p>Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight. An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be. It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attack rolls and its ranged attack rolls. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot see.</p>\n</div><div topic='Assume Equipment' level='8'><p><b>Assume Equipment (Su):</b> Beginning at 3rd level, a psion uncarnate can designate a number of pieces of his worn equipment (including armor and weapons) equal to his psion uncarnate level to become incorporeal when he uses his shed body ability. This has no effect on the equipment's function, but now when the psion uncarnate is incorporeal, he can enter or pass through solid objects while wearing nothing other than the designated equipment. Once designated, the equipment automatically changes to incorporeal when the character sheds his body, and it returns to corporeality when the character does. The character can change his designations as he desires.</p>\n</div><div topic='Assume Likeness' level='8'><p><b>Assume Likeness (Su):</b> At 4th level and higher, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can assume the likeness of any Small, Medium, or Large creature as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The character's abilities do not change, but he appears to be the creature that he assumes the likeness of, allowing him the ability to effectively disguise himself and bluff those who might wonder at his true nature. Each physical interaction with a creature requires a successful Bluff check (opposed by the creature's Sense Motive check) to convince the creature of the psion uncarnate's new appearance. The psion uncarnate must not do anything to give away his true (incorporeal) nature in order for the bluff to be successful; for instance, if he accepts an item from another creature only to have it fall through his immaterial hands, the Bluff check automatically fails. However, a Bluff check would be allowed if the psion uncarnate uses his telekinetic force ability (see below) to hold the received item.</p><p>When using his assume likeness ability, a psion uncarnate has an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If he can read an opponent's mind, he gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.</p>\n</div><div topic='Telekinetic Force' level='8'><p><b>Telekinetic Force (Su):</b> Beginning at 7th level, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can use a telekinetic force effect as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The save DC is equal to 14 + the psion uncarnate's key ability modifier (either Int, Wis, or Cha). The character's manifester level is the manifester level of the effect.</p><p>Even while corporeal, a psion uncarnate can use this ability, but only three times per day (uses while he is uncarnate do not count against this use limit).</p>\n</div><div topic='Uncarnate Bridge' level='8'><p><b>Uncarnate Bridge (Su):</b> At 8th level, as a creature of almost pure mind, a psion uncarnate becomes more closely attuned to the minds of other creatures. He gains the ability to transport himself via the minds of living creatures. Once per day as a standard action while incorporeal, he can seamlessly enter any living creature with an Intelligence score and pass to another living creature with an Intelligence score that is within line of sight of the first creature.</p><p>The psion uncarnate must be in a space adjacent to the entry creature before transporting, and he appears in a space adjacent to the destination creature after transporting. The entry and destination creatures need not be familiar to the character. A psion uncarnate cannot use himself as the entry or destination creature. Neither creature need be a willing participant.</p><p>When exiting the destination creature, the psion uncarnate chooses an adjacent square in which to appear. Entering and leaving a creature is painless, unless the psion uncarnate wishes otherwise (see below). In most cases, though, the destination creature finds being the endpoint of a mental bridge surprising and quite unsettling.</p><p>If he desires, a psion uncarnate can destructively exit the destination creature. If the creature fails a Will save (DC 15 + psion uncarnate's key ability modifier), the exiting psion uncarnate tunes his mental form to destructively interfere with the target's mind. He bursts forth explosively from the creature's body, dealing it 10d6 points of damage.</p>\n</div><div topic='Uncarnate' level='8'><p><b>Uncarnate (Ex):</b> At 10th level, a psion uncarnate becomes a being of pure psionic consciousness. This ability is similar to shed body, except the character is permanently incorporeal (and gains that subtype). If the character desires, he can become corporeal once per day for up to 1 minute, but he spends the rest of his time as an entity of mind untethered by the physical world.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

She takes no damage from a fire lash she creates, and if she releases her hold, it immediately dissipates. The lash deals 1d8 points of fire damage to a target within 15 feet on a successful ranged touch attack. A pyro can take Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization (if she otherwise meets the prerequisites) in conjunction with the fire lash, as well as any feats that apply to the use of a standard whip. The whip remains in existence as long as the pyrokineticist holds it.</p>\n</div><div topic='Fire Adaptation' level='8'><p><b>Fire Adaptation (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a pyrokineticist becomes resistant to fire, gaining a +4 bonus on all saving throws against fire and heat spells and effects. In addition, she gains fire resistance 10.</p>\n</div><div topic='Hand Afire' level='8'><p><b><i>Hand Afire</i> (Ps):</b> A pyrokineticist of 2nd level or higher can activate this ability as a move-equivalent action. Flames engulf one of the pyrokineticist's hands (but do her no harm). Her unarmed attacks with that hand are treated as armed. Such attacks deal an extra 2d6 points of fire damage.</p>\n</div><div topic='Bolt of Fire' level='8'><p><b><i>Bolt of Fire</i> (Ps):</b> Starting at 3rd level, as a standard action, a pyrokineticist can launch a bolt of psionically manifested fire at any target in line of sight within 60 feet. This effect is treated as a ranged touch attack and deals 1d6 points of fire damage for each class level the pyro has.</p>\n</div><div topic='Weapon Afire' level='8'><p><b><i>Weapon Afire</i> (Ps):</b> At 4th level and higher, a pyrokineticist can activate this ability as a move-equivalent action. Flames that harm neither her nor the weapon engulf one weapon she holds (which can be a projectile such as a stone, bullet, arrow, or bolt). The weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. The weapon retains this effect for as long as the pyrokineticist wields it.</p>\n</div><div topic='Nimbus' level='8'><p><b><i>Nimbus</i> (Ps):</b> Beginning at 5th level, a pyrokineticist can activate this ability as a move-equivalent action. Flames that harm neither the pyrokineticist nor her equipment engulf her entire body. While she is aflame, the character's Charisma score increases by 4, she can make a melee touch attack for 2d6 points of fire damage, and she gains damage reduction 5/magic. If she is struck in melee, the attacker takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This ability lasts for up to 1 minute per pyrokineticist level and is usable once per day.</p>\n</div><div topic='Firewalk' level='8'><p><b>Firewalk (Su):</b> Beginning at 6th level, as a free action a pyrokineticist can expend her psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description) to literally walk on air. She moves at her normal speed in all directions, including vertically, but cannot move more than double her speed in a round. A firewalking pyro leaves footprints of flame in the air that disperse in 2 rounds, but her tread does not deal damage. She must pay 1 power point per round spent traveling in this fashion.</p>\n</div><div topic='Fear No Fire' level='8'><p><b>Fear No Fire (Ex):</b> At 7th level, a pyrokineticist becomes highly resistant to fire, gaining a +8 bonus on all saving throws against fire and heat spells and effects and also gaining fire resistance 20.</p>\n</div><div topic='Greater Weapon Afire' level='8'><p><b><i>Greater Weapon Afire</i> (Ps):</b> At 8th level, when a pyrokineticist activates her hand afire ability or her weapon afire ability, her unarmed attack or weapon deals an extra 4d6 points of fire damage instead of 2d6. Touch attacks made while she uses the nimbus ability likewise deal 4d6 points of damage instead of 2d6.</p>\n</div><div topic='Heat Death' level='8'><p><b><i>Heat Death</i> (Ps):</b> A pyrokineticist who reaches 9th level can expend her psionic focus and take a full attack action to raise the internal temperature of one living creature within 30 feet to lethal levels. The target must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw (DC 14 + pyro's Cha modifier) or die horrifically as its blood (or other internal fluid) boils. Even on a successful save, the target takes 4d8 points of fire damage from the heat.</p>\n</div><div topic='Conflagration' level='8'><p><b><i>Conflagration</i> (Ps):</b> At 10th level, a pyrokineticist gains the ability to create a massive burst of raging flames around herself, burning everything in the area. Once per day, as a standard action, she can use this ability to deal 15d6 points of fire damage in a 30-foot-radius burst emanating from herself. Any creature or object caught in the burst can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 15 + pyro's Cha modifier) for half damage. Anyone failing the Reflex save against the <i>Conflagration</i> must also make a Fortitude saving throw (same DC) or die due to extreme shock from the intense heat.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added to the ranger's list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind.</p><p>This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger's effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.</p>\n</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><p><b>Spells:</b> Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).</p><p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ranger does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.</p><p>A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a <i>cure</i> spell in its place. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p><p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Improved Combat Style' level='8'><p><b>Improved Combat Style (Ex):</b> At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p><p>If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p><p>As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>\n</div><div topic='Woodland Stride' level='8'><p><b>Woodland Stride (Ex):</b> Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p><p>However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.</p>\n</div><div topic='Swift Tracker' level='8'><p><b>Swift Tracker (Ex):</b> Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>\n</div><div topic='Evasion' level='8'><p><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>\n</div><div topic='Combat Style Mastery' level='8'><p><b>Combat Style Mastery (Ex):</b> At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p><p>If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p><p>As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>\n</div><div topic='Camouflage' level='8'><p><b>Camouflage (Ex):</b> A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</p>\n</div><div topic='Hide in Plain Sight' level='8'><p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):</b> While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

level='5'><p><h5><b>Class Features</b></h5></p><p>All of the following are class features of the rogue.</p><div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>\n</div><div topic='Sneak Attack' level='8'><p><b>Sneak Attack:</b> If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.</p><p>The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.</p><p>Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p><p>With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.</p><p>A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.</p>\n</div><div topic='Trapfinding' level='8'><p><b>Trapfinding:</b> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20.</p><p>Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.</p><p>Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.</p><p>A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.</p>\n</div><div topic='Evasion' level='8'><p><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>\n</div><div topic='Trap Sense' level='8'><p><b>Trap Sense (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.</p><p>Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>\n</div><div topic='Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.</p><p>If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>\n</div><div topic='Improved Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.</p><p>This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.</p><p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>\n</div><div topic='Special Abilities' level='8'><p><b>Special Abilities:</b> On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.</p><p><i>Crippling Strike (Ex):</i> A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.</p><p><i>Defensive Roll (Ex):</i> The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll-if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.</p><p><i>Improved Evasion (Ex):</i> This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</p><p><i>Opportunist (Ex):</i> Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round.</p><p><i>Skill Mastery:</i> The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.</p><p>Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.</p><p><i>Slippery Mind (Ex):</i> This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.</p><p><i>Feat:</i> A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

Shadowdancers are proficient with light armor but not with shields.</p>\n</div><div topic='Hide in Plain Sight' level='8'><p><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Su):</b> A shadowdancer can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, a shadowdancer can hide herself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow.</p>\n</div><div topic='Evasion' level='8'><p><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains evasion. If exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. The evasion ability can only be used if the shadowdancer is wearing light armor or no armor.</p>\n</div><div topic='Darkvision' level='8'><p><b>Darkvision (Su):</b> At 2nd level, a shadowdancer can see in the dark as though she were permanently under the effect of a <i>darkvision</i> spell.</p>\n</div><div topic='Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><p><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a shadowdancer retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (She still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)</p><p>If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).</p>\n</div><div topic='Shadow Illusion' level='8'><p><b><i>Shadow Illusion</i> (Sp):</b> When a shadowdancer reaches 3rd level, she can create visual illusions. This ability's effect is identical to that of the arcane spell <i>silent image</i> and may be employed once per day.</p>\n</div><div topic='Summon Shadow' level='8'><p><b>Summon Shadow (Su):</b> At 3rd level, a shadowdancer can summon a shadow, an undead shade. Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow's alignment matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature cannot create spawn. The summoned shadow cannot be turned, rebuked, or commanded by any third party. This shadow serves as a companion to the shadowdancer and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer. Every third level gained by the shadowdancer adds +2 HD (and the requisite base attack and base save bonus increases) to her shadow companion.</p><p>If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses to dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. If the saving throw fails, the shadowdancer loses 200 experience points per shadowdancer level. A successful saving throw reduces the loss by half, to 100 XP per prestige class level. The shadowdancer's XP total can never go below 0 as the result of a shadow's dismissal or destruction. A destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 days.</p>\n</div><div topic='Shadow Jump' level='8'><p><b>Shadow Jump (Su):</b> At 4th level, a shadowdancer gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a <i>dimension door</i> spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A shadowdancer can jump up to a total of 20 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 20 feet or two jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th, the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (40 feet at 6th, 80 feet at 8th, and 160 feet at 10th). This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.</p>\n</div><div topic='Defensive Roll' level='8'><p><b>Defensive Roll (Ex):</b> Starting at 5th level, once per day, when a shadowdancer would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), she can attempt to roll with the damage. She makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if successful, takes only half damage from the blow. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll. If she is in a situation that would deny her any Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't attempt a defensive roll.</p>\n</div><div topic='Improved Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><p><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> At 5th level, a shadowdancer can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the shadowdancer. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the shadowdancer can flank her (and thus sneak attack her).</p><p>If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>\n</div><div topic='Slippery Mind' level='8'><p><b>Slippery Mind (Ex):</b> At 7th level, if a shadowdancer is affected by an enchantment and fails her saving throw, 1 round later she can attempt her saving throw again. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed at her saving throw. If it fails as well, the spell's effects occur normally.</p>\n</div><div topic='Improved Evasion' level='8'><p><b>Improved Evasion (Ex):</b> This ability, gained at 10th level, works like evasion (see above). A shadowdancer takes no damage at all on successful saving throws against attacks that allow a Reflex saving throw for half damage. What's more, she takes only half damage even if she fails her saving throw.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on).

Any creature that attempts to eat the slayer's brain must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + slayer's class level) or become disinclined to do so for 24 hours thereafter.

This ability protects against information gathering by clairsentience powers or effects that reveal location.</p><p>The ability even foils <i>bend reality</i>,  <i>limited wish</i>,  <i>miracle</i>,  <i>reality revision</i>,  and <i>wish</i> when they are used to gain information about the slayer's location (however, <i>metafaculty</i> can pierce this protective barrier). In the case of <i>remote viewing</i> or <i>scrying</i> that scans an area a slayer is in, the effect works, but the slayer simply isn't detected. <i>remote viewing</i> or <i>scrying</i> attempts that are targeted specifically at a slayer do not work. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.</p>\n</div><div topic='Breach Power Resistance' level='8'><p><b>Breach Power Resistance (Su):</b> A slayer of 8th level or higher can enhance her weapon with psionic might. Each successful melee attack (or ranged attack if the target is within 30 feet) she makes with her weapon against a creature with power resistance temporarily reduces its power resistance by 1. Unless the creature is slain, its lost power resistance returns all at once 12 hours later. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.</p>\n</div><div topic='Cerebral Immunity' level='8'><p><b>Cerebral Immunity (Su):</b> On reaching 9th level, a slayer gains protection from all devices, powers, and spells that influence the mind. This ability shields her against almost all mind-affecting powers and effects (though the slayer can selectively allow powers or spells to affect her). The ability even foils <i>bend reality</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>,  <i>reality revision</i>, and <i>wish</i> when they are used to mentally influence a slayer. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.</p>\n</div><div topic='Blast Feedback' level='8'><p><b>Blast Feedback (Su):</b> At 10th level, if a slayer makes her saving throw when attacked with <i>mind blast</i>,  the <i>mind blast</i> rebounds upon the attacker. Only the original attacker is targeted in the rebound effect. If the original attacker fails a Will saving throw (DC equal to that of the original attack), the attacker is affected normally by the <i>mind blast</i>.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's Charisma modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.</p><p>A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can't use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.</p><p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer 'loses' the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p><p>Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he'll cast.</p>\n</div><div topic='Familiar' level='8'><p><b>Familiar:</b> A sorcerer can obtain a familiar (see below). Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.</p><p>The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.</p><p>If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.</p><p>A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

topic='Class Features' level='5'><p><h5><b>Class Features</b></h5></p><p>All the following are class features of the soulknife.</p><div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Soulknives are proficient with all simple weapons, with their own mind blades, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>\n</div><div topic='Mind Blade' level='8'><p><b>Mind Blade (Su):</b> As a move action, a soulknife can create a semisolid blade composed of psychic energy distilled from his own mind. The blade is identical in all ways (except visually) to a short sword of a size appropriate for its wielder. For instance, a Medium soulknife materializes a Medium mind blade that he can wield as a light weapon, and the blade deals 1d6 points of damage (crit 19-20/x2). Soulknives who are smaller or larger than Medium create mind blades identical to short swords appropriate for their size, with a corresponding change to the blade's damage. The wielder of a mind blade gains the usual benefits to his attack roll and damage roll from a high Strength bonus.</p><p>The blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p><p>A soulknife can use feats such as Power Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind blade just as if it were a normal weapon. He can also choose mind blade for feats requiring a specific weapon choice, such as Weapon Specialization. Powers or spells that upgrade weapons can be used on a mind blade.</p><p>A soulknife's mind blade improves as the character gains higher levels. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, the mind blade gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls (+2 at 8th level, +3 at 12th level, +4 at 16th level, and +5 at 20th level).</p><p>Even in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a <i>null psionics field</i>), a soulknife can attempt to sustain his mind blade by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the soulknife maintains his mind blade for a number of rounds equal to his class level before he needs to check again. On an unsuccessful attempt, the mind blade vanishes. As a move action on his turn, the soulknife can attempt a new Will save to rematerialize his mind blade while he remains within the psionics negating effect.</p>\n</div><div topic='Weapon Focus' level='8'><p><b>Weapon Focus (Mind Blade):</b> A soulknife gains Weapon Focus (mind blade) as a bonus feat.</p>\n</div><div topic='Wild Talent' level='8'><p><b>Wild Talent:</b> A soulknife gains Wild Talent as a bonus feat. (This class feature provides the character with the psionic power he needs to materialize his mind blade, if he has no power points otherwise.)</p>\n</div><div topic='Throw Mind Blade' level='8'><p><b>Throw Mind Blade (Ex):</b> A soul knife of 2nd level or higher can throw his mind blade as a ranged weapon with a range increment of 30 feet.</p><p>Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a psychic strike (see below) with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special abilities (such as Knife to the Soul; see below).</p>\n</div><div topic='Psychic Strike' level='8'><p><b>Psychic Strike (Su):</b> As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue his mind blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of damage to the next living, nonmindless target he successfully hits with a melee attack (or ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade ability). Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike damage. (Unlike the rogue's sneak attack, the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to mind-affecting effects.)</p><p>A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is called upon, but a soulknife can imbue his mind blade with psychic energy again by taking another move action.</p><p>Once a soulknife has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra energy until it is used. Even if the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown and misses), it is still imbued with psychic energy when the soulknife next materializes it.</p><p>At every four levels beyond 3rd (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th), the extra damage from a soulknife's psychic strike increases as shown on the Table above.</p>\n</div><div topic='Free Draw' level='8'><p><b>Free Draw (Su):</b> At 5th level, a soulknife becomes able to materialize his mind blade as a free action instead of a move action. He can make only one attempt to materialize the mind blade per round, however.</p>\n</div><div topic='Shape Mind Blade' level='8'><p><b>Shape Mind Blade (Su):</b> At 5th level, a soulknife gains the ability to change the form of his mind blade. As a fullround action, he can change his mind blade to replicate a longsword (damage 1d8 for a Medium weapon wielded as a one-handed weapon) or a bastard sword (damage 1d10 for a Medium weapon, but he must wield it as a two-handed weapon unless he knows the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (bastard sword) feat). If a soulknife shapes his mind blade into the form of a bastard sword and wields it two-handed, he adds 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus to his damage rolls, just like when using any other two-handed weapon.</p><p>Alternatively, a soulknife can split his mind blade into two identical short swords, suitable for fighting with a weapon in each hand. (The normal penalties for fighting with two weapons apply.) However, both mind blades have an enhancement bonus 1 lower than the soulknife would otherwise create with a single mind blade.</p>\n</div><div topic='Mind Blade Enhancement' level='8'><p><b>Mind Blade Enhancement (Su):</b> At 6th level, a soulknife gains the ability to enhance his mind blade. He can add any one of the weapon special abilities on the table below that has an enhancement bonus value of +1.</p><p>At every four levels beyond 6th (10th, 14th, and 18th), the value of the enhancement a soulknife can add to his weapon improves to +2, +3, and +4, respectively. A soulknife can choose any combination of weapon special abilities that does not exceed the total allowed by the soulknife's level.</p><p>The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the soulknife materializes his mind blade (unless he decides to reassign its abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes, including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities.</p><p/><table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td><b>Weapon Special Ability</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Enhancement Bonus Value</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Defending<br/></td>\n<td>+1<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Keen<br/></td>\n<td>+1<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Lucky*<br/></td>\n<td>+1<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Mighty cleaving<br/></td>\n<td>+1<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Psychokinetic*<br/></td>\n<td>+1<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Sundering*<br/></td>\n<td>+1<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Vicious<br/></td>\n<td>+1<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Collision*<br/></td>\n<td>+2<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Mindcrusher*<br/></td>\n<td>+2<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Psychokinetic burst*<br/></td>\n<td>+2<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Suppression*<br/></td>\n<td>+2<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Wounding<br/></td>\n<td>+2<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Bodyfeeder*<br/></td>\n<td>+3<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Mindfeeder*<br/></td>\n<td>+3<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>Soulbreaker*<br/></td>\n<td>+3<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='2'>\n<td colspan='2'>*New special abilities<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table><p/><p>A soulknife can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade.

If complicated or convoluted condition as are prescribed, the contingent conjuration may fail when triggered.

It takes an offering of 1,000 gp x the HD of the creature to convince it to serve as a planar cohort, and the improved ally class feature can't be used to reduce or eliminate this cost. The planar cohort can't have more Hit Dice than the thaumaturgist has, and must have an ECL no higher than the thaumaturgist's character level -2.</p><p>A thaumaturgist can have only one planar cohort at a time, but he can continue to make agreements with other called creatures normally.

armor, and with shields (except tower shields).</p>\n</div><div topic='Power Points/Day' level='8'><p><b>Power Points/Day:</b> A wilder's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points she has available. Her base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Wilder. In addition, she receives bonus power points per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). Her race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.</p>\n</div><div topic='Powers Known' level='8'><p><b>Powers Known:</b> A wilder begins play knowing one wilder power of your choice. At every even-numbered class level after 1st, she unlocks the knowledge of new powers.</p><p>Choose the powers known from the wilder power list. (<i>Exception:</i> The feats Expanded Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge do allow a wilder to learn powers from the lists of other classes.) A wilder can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than her manifester level.</p><p>The total number of powers a wilder can manifest in a day is limited only by her daily power points.</p><p>A wilder simply knows her powers; they are ingrained in her mind. She does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though she must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all her spent power points.</p><p>The Difficulty Class for saving throws against wilder powers is 10 + the power's level + the wilder's Charisma modifier.</p>\n</div><div topic='Maximum Power Level Known' level='8'><p><b>Maximum Power Level Known:</b> A wilder begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As she attains higher levels, she may gain the ability to master more complex powers.</p><p>To learn or manifest a power, a wilder must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the power's level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Wild Surge' level='8'><p><b>Wild Surge (Su)</b>: A wilder can let her passion and emotion rise to the surface in a wild surge when she manifests a power. During a wild surge, a wilder gains phenomenal psionic strength, but may harm herself by the reckless use of her power (see Psychic Enervation, below).</p><p>A wilder can choose to invoke a wild surge whenever she manifests a power. When she does so, she gains +1 to her manifester level with that manifestation of the power. The manifester level boost gives her the ability to augment her powers to a higher degree than she otherwise could; however, she pays no extra power point for this wild surge. Instead, the additional 1 power point that would normally be required to augment the power is effectively supplied by the wild surge.</p><p>Level-dependent power effects are also improved, depending on the power a wilder manifests with her wild surge.</p><p>This improvement in manifester level does not grant her any other benefits (psicrystal abilities do not advance, she does not gain higher-level class abilities, and so on).</p><p>She cannot use the Overchannel psionic feat and invoke her wild surge at the same time.</p><p>At 3rd level, a wilder can choose to boost her manifester level by two instead of one. At 7th level, she can boost her manifester level by up to three; at 11th level, by up to four; at 15th level, by up to five; and at 19th level, by up to six.</p><p>In all cases, the wild surge effectively pays the extra power point cost that is normally required to augment the power; only the unaugmented power point cost is subtracted from the wilder's power point reserve.</p>\n</div><div topic='Psychic Enervation' level='8'><p><b>Psychic Enervation (Ex):</b> Pushing oneself by invoking a wild surge is dangerous. Immediately following each wild surge, a wilder may be overcome by the strain of her effort. The chance of suffering psychic enervation is equal to 5% per manifester level added with the wild surge.</p><p>A wilder who is overcome by psychic enervation is dazed until the end of her next turn and loses a number of power points equal to her wilder level.</p>\n</div><div topic='Elude Touch' level='8'><p><b>Elude Touch (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a wilder's intuition supersedes her intellect, alerting her to danger from touch attacks (including rays). She gains a bonus to Armor Class against all touch attacks equal to her Charisma bonus; however, her touch AC can never exceed her Armor Class against normal attacks.</p>\n</div><div topic='Surging Euphoria' level='8'><p><b>Surging Euphoria (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th level, when a wilder uses her wild surge ability, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the intensity of her wild surge.</p><p>If a wilder is overcome by psychic enervation following her wild surge, she does not gain the morale bonus for this use of her wild surge ability.</p><p>At 12th level, the morale bonus on a wilder's attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws increases to +2. At 20th level, the bonus increases to +3.</p>\n</div><div topic='Volatile Mind' level='8'><p><b>Volatile Mind (Ex):</b> A wilder's temperamental mind is hard to encompass with the discipline of telepathy. When any telepathy power is manifested on a wilder of 5th level or higher, the manifester of the power must pay 1 power point more than he otherwise would have spent.</p><p>The extra cost is not a natural part of that power's cost. It does not augment the power; it is simply a wasted power point. The wilder's volatile mind can force the manifester of the telepathy power to exceed the normal power point limit of 1 point per manifester level. If the extra cost raises the telepathy power's cost to more points than the manifester has remaining in his reserve, the power simply fails, and the manifester exhausts the rest of his power points.</p><p>At 9th level, the penalty assessed against telepathy powers manifested on a wilder is increased to 2 power points. At 13th level, the penalty increases to 3 power points, and at 17th level it increases to 4 power points.</p><p>As a standard action, a wilder can choose to lower this effect for 1 round.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",

Armor Proficiency:</b> Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>\n</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><p><b>Spells:</b> A wizard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time (see below).</p><p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard's Intelligence modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Wizard. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.</p><p>Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good night's sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.</p>\n</div><div topic='Bonus Languages' level='8'><p><b>Bonus Languages:</b> A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>\n</div><div topic='Familiar' level='8'><p><b>Familiar:</b> A wizard can obtain a familiar in exactly the same manner as a sorcerer can. See the sorcerer description and the information on Familiars below for details.</p>\n</div><div topic='Scribe Scroll' level='8'><p><b>Scribe Scroll:</b> At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.</p>\n</div><div topic='Bonus Feats' level='8'><p><b>Bonus Feats:</b> At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.</p><p>These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these feats.</p>\n</div><div topic='Spellbooks' level='8'><p><b>Spellbooks:</b> A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for <i>read magic</i>, which all wizards can prepare from memory.</p><p>A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any; see School Specialization, below) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks to her own.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div><div topic='School Specialization' level='3'><p><h3>School Specialization</h3></p><p>A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme. If desired, a wizard may specialize in one school of magic (see below). Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but she then never learns to cast spells from some other schools.</p><p>A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.</p><p>The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty at 1st level. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination; see below), which become her prohibited schools.</p><p>A wizard can never give up divination to fulfill this requirement.</p><p>Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the wizard, and she can't even cast such spells from scrolls or fire them from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her prohibited schools later.</p><p>The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.</p><p>Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal spells.</p><p><i>Abjuration:</i> Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration specialist is called an abjurer.</p><p><i>Conjuration:</i> Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A conjuration specialist is called a conjurer.</p><p><i>Divination:</i> Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is called a diviner. Unlike the other specialists, a diviner must give up only one other school.</p><p><i>Enchantment:</i> Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter.</p><p><i>Evocation:</i> Spells that manipulate energy or create something from nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker.</p><p><i>Illusion:</i> Spells that alter perception or create false images. An illusion specialist is called an illusionist.</p><p><i>Necromancy:</i> Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life force. A necromancy specialist is called a necromancer.</p><p><i>Transmutation:</i> Spells that transform the recipient physically or change its properties in a more subtle way. A transmutation specialist is called a transmuter.</p><p><i>Universal:</i> Not a school, but a category for spells that all wizards can learn. A wizard cannot select universal as a specialty school or as a prohibited school. Only a limited number of spells fall into this category.</p><p/>\n</div><div topic='Familiars' level='3'><p><h3>Familiars</h3></p><p>A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar.

Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee attack bonus with natural weapons.</p><p>Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.</p><p><i>Saving Throws:</i> For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master's (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.</p><p><i>Skills:</i> For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master's skill ranks, whichever are better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use.</p>\n</div><div topic='Familiar Ability Descriptions' level='8'><p><b>Familiar Ability Descriptions:</b> All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master's combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities given on the table are cumulative.</p><p><i>Natural Armor Adj.:</i> The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar's existing natural armor bonus.</p><p><i>Int:</i> The familiar's Intelligence score.</p><p><i>Alertness (Ex):</i> While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the Alertness feat.</p><p><i>Improved Evasion (Ex):</i> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.</p><p><i>Share Spells:</i> At the master's option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his familiar. The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit.</p><p>If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the duration expires. Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a target of 'You' on his familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself.</p><p>A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar's type (magical beast).</p><p><i>Empathic Link (Su):</i> The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master cannot see through the familiar's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.</p><p>Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.</p><p><i>Deliver Touch Spells (Su):</i> If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the 'toucher.' The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.</p><p><i>Speak with Master (Ex):</i> If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.</p><p><i>Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex):</i> If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.</p><p><i>Spell Resistance (Ex):</i> If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance.</p><p><i>Scry on Familiar (Sp):</i> If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the <i>scrying</i> spell) once per day.</p><p/><table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'>\n\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td><b>Master Class Level</b> <br/></td> <td><b>Natural Armor Adj</b>. <br/></td>\n<td><b>Int</b> <br/></td>\n<td><b>Special</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td>1st-2nd<br/></td>\n<td>+1<br/></td>\n<td>6<br/></td>\n<td>Alertness, improved evasion, share spells, empathic link<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td>3rd-4th<br/></td>\n<td>+2<br/></td>\n<td>7<br/></td>\n<td>Deliver touch spells<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td>5th-6th<br/></td>\n<td>+3<br/></td>\n<td>8<br/></td>\n<td>Speak with master<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td>7th-8th<br/></td>\n<td>+4<br/></td>\n<td>9<br/></td>\n<td>Speak with animals of its kind<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td>9th-10th<br/></td>\n<td>+5<br/></td>\n<td>10<br/></td>\n<td>-<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td>11th-12th<br/></td>\n<td>+6<br/></td>\n<td>11<br/></td>\n<td>Spell resistance<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td>13th-14th<br/></td>\n<td>+7<br/></td>\n<td>12<br/></td>\n<td><i>Scry</i> on familiar<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td>15th-16th<br/></td>\n<td>+8<br/></td>\n<td>13<br/></td>\n<td>-<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td>17th-18th<br/></td>\n<td>+9<br/></td>\n<td>14<br/></td>\n<td>-<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'>\n<td>19th-20th<br/></td>\n<td>+10<br/></td>\n<td>15<br/></td>\n<td>-<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table><p/>\n</div>\n</div><div topic='Arcane Spells and Armor' level='3'><p><h3>Arcane Spells and Armor</h3></p><p>Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively.</p><p>If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they'll be clumsy in it), or they can gain training in the proper use of armor (with the various Armor Proficiency feats-light, medium, and heavy-and the Shield Proficiency feat), or they can multiclass to add a class that grants them armor proficiency. Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing armor with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere with spellcasting.</p><p>Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must make while casting any spell that has a somatic component (most do). The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.</p><p>By contrast, bards not only know how to wear light armor effectively, but they can also ignore the arcane spell failure chance for such armor. A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes proficient with that armor.</p><p>If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no problem while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster's hands are bound or if he or she is grappling (although Concentration checks still apply normally). Also, the metamagic feat Still Spell allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic component. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.</p><p/>\n</div>\n</div>\n    ",
